# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) — Production Examples & P²C PETC v1.2 Governance

This module defines seven production-grade architectural decision records governing the
Multiplicity sovereign kernel and the **P²C PETC v1.2** (Provenance Enforcement Tensor Calculus):

1. **ADR-001:** Integer Jordan Bond arithmetic (Fixed-point N=1024, superseding float approximations).
2. **ADR-002:** Sedona Spine retention engine as sole source of truth for litigation hold risk.
3. **ADR-003:** Per-Triad Resonance Floors (Audit v2), superseding ADR-001's aggregate-only audit.
4. **ADR-004:** Meet-Semilattice Partition Refinement & LCR Operator (P²C PETC v1.2).
5. **ADR-005:** BLAKE2b-16 Personalization & Canonical Bytecode Wire Format (P²C PETC v1.2).
6. **ADR-006:** MultiContract Atomic Contraction with PartialSum Tokens (P²C PETC v1.2).
7. **ADR-007:** Commutative Collective Transformers for Deterministic Sharding Commit (P²C PETC v1.2).

All records are bundled into a verified `ADRRegistry` with machine-checked invariant proofs.
