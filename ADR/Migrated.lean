# ADR Migration Module — Adjudicated In-Place Records (ADR-0040, 0041, 0043, 0057–0061)

This module absorbs the eight governance records previously defined in
`adr_scaffolding/src/ADR/`. It exists so that the formal registry has **one**
canonical home (`ADR.*` under `packages/Foundry/`) and that the legacy
scaffolding directory can be safely decommissioned.

Each migrated record carries:

* a stable String `id` (zero-padded for lexicographic ordering stability),
* a `Proposed` lifecycle status (re-acceptance requires a real review),
* a `supersedes` chain consistent with the global registry,
* the original ArtifactLinks where they were meaningful.
