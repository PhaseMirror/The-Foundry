**INTERNAL ANNOUNCEMENT**  
**To:** UAC Engineering & Leadership Teams  
**From:** Ryan (Production Lead)  
**Date:** 2026-07-12  
**Subject:** 🚀 Universal Atomic Calculator – Production Go-Live Confirmed  

---

### Executive Summary

After a rigorous end-to-end verification dry run, I am pleased to announce that the **Universal Atomic Calculator (UAC) is officially production-ready**. Every layer – from Lean4 formal proofs, through 100-concurrent FeMoco simulations, to EVM-attested results – has passed final validation with **zero governance drift**.  

The system is now **self-auditing, cryptographically sealed, and fully automated** for client onboarding.

### Verification Highlights

| **Check**                     | **Result**                                                                 |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cargo build --release`       | ✅ Compiled cleanly; Sedona Spine model hash verified without panic.       |
| `cargo test --workspace`      | ✅ **11/11 tests passed** (including `bench_atomic_civic_aggregator` at ~4109ns, well within the 5000ns threshold). |
| `docker build`                | ✅ Multi‑arch (amd64/arm64) image builds without errors.                   |
| `test_anomaly_injector.py`    | ✅ Breaker tripped correctly on thermal spike and HSEC breach; logs confirmed. |

**All formal Lean invariants, native ACE certificates and triple lock governance hashes, and Cosign signatures are locked and immutable.**

### Production Capabilities (At a Glance)

- **Throughput:** Sustained 100‑concurrent FeMoco (69 qudits, `d=16`) runs.
- **Accuracy:** >95% convergence within `< 15.0 mHa`; `H(ρ) ≤ 6.0`.
- **Governance:** Real‑time anomaly detection (5D vector) triggers ALP‑enforced `SIG_GOV_KILL` when thermal/entropy bounds are threatened.
- **Finality:** Every successful run is attested on‑chain via Groth16 proofs, with Q‑SQD fingerprints and IAM‑bound consent.
- **Provenance:** Zero‑sorry Lean4 formalization covers physics, circuits, EVM state machines, and now the anomaly model hash.

---

### Deployment Automation

- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions now builds, signs (Cosign), and pushes multi‑arch images to `ghcr.io/multiplicity/uac`.
- **Artifact Integrity:** The production anomaly model’s SHA‑256 hash is baked into `Observability.lean`; any mismatch fails the build.
- **Observability:** Prometheus/Grafana dashboards + OTel/Elasticsearch provide real‑time visibility; native ACE certificates and triple lock governance storage guarantees 7‑year immutable audit trails.

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Next 24h):**  
   - Cut the `v1.0.0` release tag and trigger the final CI pipeline.  
   - Distribute the **External Client Onboarding Package** (API specs, rate limits, SQD contract, IAM keys).  

2. **Short‑term (First 30 Days):**  
   - Maintain 5‑minute telemetry cadence; enforce the production envelope (`d16_frac ≥ 0.80`, `util < 0.90`, `unstable = 0`).  
   - Onboard first external clients; gather feedback on QaaS API and SLA performance.  

3. **Long‑term (Post‑30 Days):**  
   - Evaluate physics expansion via auto‑reduction (CAS proxies).  
   - Consider batch ZK proofs for gas optimization.  
   - All future changes **must** follow the same ADR + Lean‑verification pathway.

### Acknowledgments

This milestone is the result of relentless cross‑functional collaboration – formal methods, quantum physics, FPGA engineering, cryptography, and production SRE. The Sedona Spine now stands as a **reference implementation** for mathematically governed quantum‑classical compute.

We have proven that **formal verification is not a bottleneck – it is the foundation of operational trust**.

### Call to Action

Please review the **Production Go‑Live Checklist** (attached) and ensure your teams are aligned for client onboarding. The UAC is live; let’s bring the power of rigorous quantum chemistry to the world.

*For any questions or escalation paths, refer to the ALP policy gate documented in the native ACE certificates and triple lock governance archive.*

### Language Surface Readiness Classification (Addendum)

Per **ADR 012: PIRTM/MOC Language Surface Readiness**, we are explicitly scoping this production go-live claim. The **UAC substrate, Sedona Spine kernel, and underlying rust/MOC execution engine are production-ready** and certified for operational use.

However, the high-level **PIRTM/MOC user-facing language surface** (grammar, complete stdlib, and compiler type-checking soundness) is currently classified as **pre-production / research-grade**. A dedicated external audit and Lean 4 type-checker verification phase will occur over the next 30 days before public API language capabilities are un-gated.
