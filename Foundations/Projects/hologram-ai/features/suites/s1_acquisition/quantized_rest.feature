Feature: A quant-tiered model rests quantized
  The Rest axis applied to the quantized tier (row `quantized-transit`,
  stated per model by the catalogue — data, never code, and never silent):
  the download derives each fully-retirable projection's matmul-ready int8
  artifact IN THE BROWSER and evaporates its wide blob. The wide form
  transits once and rests nowhere; recorded provenance keeps it recoverable,
  and a missing artifact re-derives at session warm, fail-closed on its
  recorded κ (derive-as-recovery). The κ-store holds the quantized form —
  roughly a quarter of the wide bytes — and the chat journey runs on it,
  narrating the tier.

  Background:
    Given the app is open in the browser against the hermetic model server
    And a forced single-layer execution window
    And the quantized tier is forced

  Scenario: the download derives artifacts and the wide forms go gas-phase
    When the fixture model is downloaded
    Then the κ-store holds every quantized artifact and no gas-phase wide blob

  Scenario: chat runs on the quantized tier and says so
    Given the fixture model is downloaded
    When a single-turn prompt is sent
    Then a non-empty completion streams back
    And the session narration states the quantized tier
