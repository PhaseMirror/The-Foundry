//! UOR-native declarative rewrite rules over `AiGraph`.
//!
//! Replaces the bespoke imperative `opt/*Fusion` passes with a confluent
//! fixed-point rewrite over a typed canonical form (ADR-0018).
//!
//! ## Canonical pieces
//!
//! - [`Pattern`] declares the input sub-graph a rule recognizes — a tree
//!   of `Op`s with leaves that bind to graph tensors as [`VarId`]s.
//!   `Maybe` expresses architecture-specific differences (e.g. biased
//!   vs unbiased projections) as **declared alternates**, not as
//!   separate code.
//!
//! - [`Replacement`] declares the canonical replacement — a single
//!   `AiOp` node whose inputs are bound `VarId`s from the pattern. The
//!   replacement reuses the matched root node's first output tensor
//!   id, so downstream consumers see the same tensor id and require no
//!   rewiring.
//!
//! - [`Rule`] = `Pattern` + `Replacement` + the citation to the external
//!   authoritative source (ONNX spec, ORT logit parity, ONNX backend
//!   node-test corpus). No rule lands without a witness.
//!
//! - [`RuleSet`] applies rules to fixed-point. Each rule either matches
//!   and rewrites or doesn't; the result is independent of rule order
//!   (rules are confluent on the canonical form). A non-confluent rule
//!   pair is caught at apply time by non-convergence.
//!
//! ## Match semantics
//!
//! A match binds each pattern [`VarId`] to a graph [`TensorId`]. The
//! root pattern matches against an `AiNode`'s op + input tensors;
//! sub-patterns recurse by following each input tensor back to its
//! producer node. When a `VarId` appears more than once in the pattern,
//! the bindings must agree (sharing is explicit, not implied).
//!
//! Op patterns at *interior* positions (non-root) require their matched
//! node to have **exactly one consumer**. Removing a multi-consumer
//! interior node would break downstream paths, so the matcher refuses
//! to match it in the first place.
//!
//! ## What this is not
//!
//! - Not e-graph saturation. Rules are confluent fixed-point rewrites
//!   on a typed canonical form — the same paradigm as
//!   `Graph::desugar_composites` upstream (ADR-055) and uor-addr's
//!   ψ-tower, applied to architecture-pattern matching.
//! - Not a DSL. Patterns are constructed as plain Rust data; macros
//!   may be added later for ergonomics but are not part of the
//!   architecture.
