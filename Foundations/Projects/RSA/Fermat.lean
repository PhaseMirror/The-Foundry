# Fermat's little theorem

We prove, from first principles and without any axioms:

  `fermat_little : Prime p → ¬ p ∣ a → a ^ (p - 1) ≡ 1 [MOD p]`

The classical proof is formalized here in its product form.  Let `p` be prime
and `p ∤ a`.  Write `up p` for the list `[1, 2, …, p - 1]`.  The map

  `x ↦ (a * x) % p`

sends `up p` into itself (every `(a * x) % p` is a nonzero residue) and is
injective on it (because `p | a * (x - y)` forces `p | x - y`, and
`0 ≤ x - y < p`), so it permutes `up p`.  Hence the product of the list is
unchanged:

  `product (up p) ≡ product (map (fun x => a * x) (up p)) [MOD p]`

The right hand side equals `a ^ (p - 1) * product (up p)` modulo `p`.  Since
`p` is prime and does not divide any factor of `product (up p)`, it does not
divide the product, so Euclid's lemma (also developed here) cancels it:

  `a ^ (p - 1) ≡ 1 [MOD p]`.

The list facts we need — product, `Nodup.map`, and the "nodup + subset +
equal length implies permutation" completeness lemma — are developed below
from `List.Perm`, which ships with core Lean.
