# Projects package — Lean 4 formalizations of the Prime/PhaseMirror projects

Build mandate (see `proofs/Kernel.lean`):
- **No `Mathlib`.** All arithmetic is discrete (`Nat` / `Int` / `Bool` / `List` /
  finite function spaces). Continuous / IEEE-754 mathematics that would otherwise
  require a real-analysis library are delegated to **Rust + Kani** verification
  harnesses (see `proofs/Kani.lean`).
- **No `sorry` / `admit`** anywhere under `proofs/`. The trusted core for the
  continuous parts is the Kani-verified Rust binary, surfaced in Lean as a small,
  explicitly specified `constant`/`axiom` bridge.

Build:  `lake build`
Test:   `lake test`
