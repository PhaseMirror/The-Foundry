# ADR 015: Bind Python rootfs builds to registry manifest digests

- Status: accepted and implemented
- Date: 2026-08-26

## Context

Python rootfs recipes accept an OCI base reference. The convenient default,
`python:3.12-slim`, is a mutable tag. Recording the local image ID after a
Docker build, as ADR 014 originally did, could describe the result but could
not prove which registry object Docker selected. Resolving a tag for reporting
after the build would also leave a race: the tag could move between resolution
and the `FROM` instruction.

`compile --check` has a separate constraint. It is a read-only, offline
validation path and must not require Docker credentials, a running engine, or
network access.

## Decision

Before a real rootfs build, resolve every mutable base reference with:

```console
docker buildx imagetools inspect --raw -- <requested-reference>
```

Require a JSON registry manifest with `schemaVersion: 2`, compute SHA-256 over
the exact raw bytes returned by Docker, and construct
`repository@sha256:<digest>`. Preserve registry ports while removing only a tag
separator after the final path slash. Write that resolved reference—not the
mutable request—into the generated Dockerfile's `FROM` instruction. The
existing `--platform` selection then chooses a platform from an immutable
index or consumes an immutable single-platform manifest.

If `source.base` is already a lowercase 64-digit SHA-256 digest reference, use
it unchanged and do not perform a registry lookup. Reject malformed registry
output and unsupported manifest schemas before staging a Docker build.

Extend ADR 014's non-canonical provenance with
`base_image.resolved_reference`. `base_image.reference` remains the source
recipe's requested value. During `compile --check`, a mutable request omits the
resolved field and reports that resolution is deferred to compilation; an
already pinned request reports itself as resolved. A completed compile always
reports the exact reference used by Docker.

The resolver does not mutate `hologram.json` or add registry evidence to the
archive. Docker's raw-manifest command owns registry transport, authentication,
and media negotiation.

The authenticated integration gate uses two isolated Docker configuration
directories. It seeds disposable registry storage without authentication,
restarts that storage behind htpasswd authentication on a fresh loopback port,
and first runs Hologram with the anonymous configuration. `compile --check`
succeeds without contacting the registry, while real compilation receives a
401 and leaves no archive. After `docker login --password-stdin` populates only
the authenticated configuration, the same source compiles and executes. The
gate recursively rejects credential-bearing provenance fields and scans JSON
reports and archive bytes for the fixture username, password, and encoded auth
value.

## Consequences

- A tag may move before resolution, but it cannot redirect the build after
  Hologram has selected and recorded the manifest digest.
- Requested intent and consumed registry identity are both queryable with
  `jq` without changing canonical application or archive identity.
- `compile --check` remains useful offline and never invents a resolved value.
- Rootfs compilation now requires a Docker CLI with Buildx image-tools support
  for mutable references. Digest-pinned references retain the previous engine
  requirement but do not require registry inspection.
- ADR 017 normalizes Docker image export and proves byte-identical config,
  layer, application, and archive identities on two clean runners for each
  supported Linux target. Completed provenance therefore reports
  `reproducible: true` after this resolver binds the base.

## Follow-up

- Produce SBOM and signed-attestation material over resolved inputs and output
  identities.
