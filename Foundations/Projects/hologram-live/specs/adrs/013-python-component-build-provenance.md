# ADR 013: Python Component build provenance is versioned and non-canonical

- Status: accepted and implemented
- Date: 2026-08-26

## Context

The portable Python compiler has three identities with different meanings:
source and toolchain inputs, the generated Wasm layer, and the canonical
Hologram application assembled around that layer. Operators need enough
evidence to explain a build and audit locked dependency selection, but adding
host-specific tool details to `AppManifest` would make those observations part
of application identity. It would also require a `.holo` format change before
the report has proven stable.

Upstream `componentize-py 0.25.0` is nondeterministic. Its pre-initializer
creates a private WASI context and obtains build-time randomness without a seed
control. Controlled dependency-free builds showed that this is not limited to
the `--stub-wasi` adapter: two non-stubbed outputs from identical inputs were
18,308,535 and 18,320,373 bytes. Their SHA-256 values were respectively
`5c3ecc2d0c4b526ae1cd4ab2014db386c9137bc5c32f8e79e966265c8a1eb873`
and `2f2c40263039a6f22dcaa24cd81ee9ff135198c6507ea9fd3c51b2805c323841`.
Rewriting the finished component is unsafe because snapshot layout and length
both change.
Caching one random output would make repeated local builds look stable without
making a clean build reproducible.

## Decision

Every `hologram compile` and `hologram compile --check` result contains a
`build_provenance` report with `schema_version: 1` and `canonical: false`.
Reports initially contained one entry for each source-compiled Python Component
layer and identified its manifest layer index. ADR 014 extends the same
versioned, non-canonical envelope to experimental Python rootfs builds without
changing the Component entry schema. Prebuilt layers remain outside the report.

A Python Component entry records:

- the `wasi-component` profile, exact Component v1 guest contract, and
  `wasm32-wasip2-component` target ABI;
- build host OS and architecture;
- Hologram compiler version, CPython `3.14.0`, componentize-py `0.25.0`, its
  release source revision, and the exact host-specific distribution URL and
  SHA-256;
- Hologram's immutable componentizer release tag/URL, the published patch-set
  manifest URL/SHA-256, and deterministic preinitialization contract;
- normalized logical paths plus SHA-256 for `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and a
  versioned source-tree digest;
- every selected dependency name, version, HTTPS wheel URL, and SHA-256 from
  the runtime lock closure;
- for a completed build, the observed uvx version, the uv dependency-installer
  version when dependencies exist, and the generated layer κ and byte length;
- for a completed build, `reproducible: true` with no blocker after the
  five-host clean-build matrix passed; offline planning remains false because
  it has not observed output.

The source-tree digest uses domain `hologram-python-source-tree-v1`, lexical
UTF-8 `/`-separated paths, file lengths, and file bytes. It deliberately ignores
directory creation order, timestamps, and permissions. Component compilation
copies those regular files to a private tree in the same lexical order. Nested
symlinks and special files fail before componentization.

`compile --check` never executes or downloads build tools. Its report therefore
omits `componentizer_runner`, `dependency_installer`, and `output`; the declared
toolchain pins and complete locked dependency inventory remain available.

The componentizer distribution is selected from a closed mapping for the five
server release hosts: macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux arm64/x86_64, and Windows
x86_64. Each entry is an exact wheel URL and SHA-256 from immutable Hologram
release `componentizer-v0.25.0-hologram.5`. The compiler passes that direct
reference to uvx with registry lookup and source builds disabled. A host
outside the mapping returns `LIVE_CAPABILITY_MISSING`; it never falls back to
version-only resolution.

Every planned and completed Component report records the componentizer patch
identity as release tag/URL, `PATCHSET.sha256` URL and SHA-256, and contract
`hologram:componentizer/preinitialization-determinism@5`. That contract fixes
the build tool's private random streams and insecure seed, clocks, preopened
filesystem metadata and access mode, guest directory enumeration, Python hash
seed, debug allocator fills, ambient package discovery, and generated
collection ordering. It controls
build-time snapshot inputs only; it does not grant secure runtime randomness.

The report is CLI result data. It is not embedded in archive metadata, the
application directory, a content blob, or the canonical `AppManifest`. It does
not affect layer, application, or archive κ values. A durable copy can be made
explicitly:

```console
hologram --json compile hologram.json --output application.holo \
  | jq '.build_provenance' > application.provenance.json
```

## Consequences

- Build validation is inspectable with `jq` before downloading the toolchain.
- A completed report ties the exact selected lock artifacts to the observed
  tool runners and emitted layer without conflating evidence with identity.
- A mutable package index cannot select a different componentizer distribution
  behind the same version; changing or adding a release host requires an
  explicit reviewed URL/hash pin.
- Reports may differ across hosts or tool runners; that is evidence, not an
  application-identity change.
- Provenance schema evolution can proceed independently and may later become a
  signed attestation. Embedding it would require a separate format and identity
  decision.
- Byte-identical Python Component output is claimed only for a completed build.
  Workflow run `33227358037` established the claim with two matching clean
  builders on every supported host; offline planning cannot make it.

## Follow-up

- Keep the reusable `component-reproducibility` gate on server releases. It
  executes and compares two isolated builds for each supported host and rejects
  either identity drift or a missing completed-build reproducibility claim.
- Rootfs observational evidence is implemented by ADR 014. Registry digest
  resolution, reproducible OCI construction, and the microVM execution
  boundary remain prerequisites for a rootfs reproducibility claim.
- Define signing and retention if provenance becomes a supply-chain
  attestation rather than ephemeral compiler output.
