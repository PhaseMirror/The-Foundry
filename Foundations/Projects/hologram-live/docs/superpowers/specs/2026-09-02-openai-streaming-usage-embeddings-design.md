# Inference engine boundary: streaming, token usage, and two in-process engines

- Date: 2026-09-02
- Status: approved design, not yet implemented
- Scope: extract the engine module (§9); implement streaming (§2–§4), token
  usage (§5), the llama.cpp engine (§10), and the `uor-r4` engine (§11);
  specify embeddings (§6) without building it
- Revised 2026-09-02 after review: the native streaming path is deferred (D6)
- Revised again 2026-09-02: D6 is reversed by D7. Ollama and llama.cpp become
  the primary engines, llama.cpp runs in-process (D8), and the trait moves
  into its own module (§9)
- Revised again 2026-09-02: `uor-r4` joins as a fifth, first-party in-process
  engine over `.holo` v4 `InferenceModel` layers (D9, §11)

## Context

`openai_compat` and `ollama_compat` translate the OpenAI and Ollama HTTP APIs
onto the `InferenceEngine` boundary from ADR 003. Both surfaces reject
`stream: true` with a typed error, and both report token usage as three nulls
that no engine ever populates.

Neither gap is module-local. Streaming and token counts are properties of the
engine, and the four engine paths do not share them:

| Engine path | Streaming | Token counts |
|---|---|---|
| `echo` | none | none — no tokenizer |
| `llamacpp` (D8) | native, in-process decode loop | exact — in-process tokenizer |
| `uor-r4` (D9) | native, in-process decode loop | exact — in-process tokenizer |
| `ollama` | native NDJSON on `/api/generate` | `eval_count` parsed today but discarded; `prompt_eval_count` unread |
| `weightc` one-shot | none — `ask --json` emits one blob at process exit | none |
| `weightc` resident JSONL | only if the external CLI emits deltas | none |

The daemon carries no streaming primitives today: no SSE, no `futures` direct
dependency, and `reqwest` without the `stream` feature.

## Decisions

### D1 — Emulate streaming on engines that cannot stream, and label it

Every engine accepts `stream: true`. Engines with native support stream real
deltas; the rest complete first and then emit the result as deltas. Responses
carry `x-hologram-stream: native | emulated`.

ADR 003 and ADR 016 forbid synthesizing data — format versions, authorization
evidence, completion state, model output. Emulated streaming synthesizes none
of it: the tokens delivered are exactly the tokens the engine produced. Only
their arrival schedule is reconstructed, which is a transport detail rather
than a claim about the completion.

Rejecting instead was considered and declined. `echo` is the default engine and
OpenAI SDKs stream on the common path, so a strict daemon would return a
capability error to the first request any stock client makes — leaving the
integration ADR 016 explicitly preserves nominally present and practically
unusable. An `emulate_streaming` config toggle was also declined: it reinstates
the two-path test matrix ADR 016 collapsed, and its honest default leaves the
default engine broken regardless.

The disclosed cost: on emulated engines, time-to-first-token equals
time-to-full-completion. The header is what makes that legible.

### D2 — Never estimate token counts

The mirror of D1. A count the engine did not report is fabricated data, which
is exactly what ADR 016 forbids. Engines report counts or report nothing; the
daemon does not tokenize, and does not substitute zero.

### D3 — Omit `usage` entirely when counts are unknown

Absence reads as "not measured"; `0` would assert a measurement no engine made.
Because OpenAI's schema requires `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and
`total_tokens` together, a partial object cannot satisfy it — so the object is
emitted only when **both** counts are known, and omitted otherwise.

This replaces `Usage { Option<u64> × 3 }` with `Option<Usage>` of plain `u64`,
a breaking change to the current response shape. The only consumer of the
existing nulls is a unit test in `src/modules/openai_compat.rs`; no desktop or
TypeScript client reads them. ADR 016 permits the break pre-release.

### D4 — Both surfaces in one landing

The engine work is shared and only the wire translation differs. The Ollama
API's own default is `stream: true`, so `ollama_compat` is the more acute gap.

Throughout this document, `ollama_compat` (the inbound HTTP surface letting
Ollama clients talk to this daemon's engines) and `OllamaEngine` (the outbound
proxy to a separate Ollama server) are distinct. Both land; the distinction
matters because they are easy to conflate when reading the diff.

### D5 — Buffered engines emit a single delta

Emulated deltas are written back-to-back with no delay, so splitting text on
whitespace conveys no timing information and invents token boundaries no
tokenizer produced. Progressive rendering should come from a real streaming
engine, not synthetic chunking.

### D6 — Defer the native streaming path (REVERSED by D7)

Retained for the record; superseded before implementation began.


`OllamaEngine` is the only engine that can stream natively or report token
counts, and the target deployment does not run Ollama: `echo` is the default
and `weightc` is the first-party engine. Building the native override now
would add the largest item in the test plan — a stub HTTP server, the only
reason dev-dependencies would grow — to serve a path nobody executes.

Deferred: the `OllamaEngine` overrides of `stream_kind` and
`complete_stream`, its `prompt_eval_count` parsing, the `reqwest` `stream`
feature, and the stub server. Everything else lands.

The trait seam is kept rather than emulating inside the modules, so adopting
a native path later needs no boundary change. This has one honest cost:
`StreamKind::Native` ships with no implementor and the header always reports
`emulated`. A two-variant enum with one reachable variant is the kind of
speculative branch ADR 016 removes elsewhere, and it is retained here only
because it is roughly five lines and spares clients a second change when a
native engine arrives. If that trade stops looking worthwhile, collapsing to
a header-free buffered-only surface is the fallback.

The higher-value follow-up is external: if `weightc enter --jsonl` emitted
incremental delta lines and token counts, this design accepts both with no
further change here — the receipt parsers are already tolerant (§5).

### D7 — Ollama and llama.cpp are the primary engines; D6 is reversed

Extended by D9, which adds `uor-r4` as a fifth engine.


D6 rested on the premise that the target deployment runs neither engine that
can stream natively or report counts. That premise no longer holds: Ollama and
llama.cpp are the two engines the project is betting on. `echo` remains the
zero-dependency default and `weightc` remains the first-party `.wcpu` path, so
the trait has four implementers.

Everything D6 deferred is restored — the native `stream_kind` and
`complete_stream` overrides, `prompt_eval_count` parsing, the `reqwest`
`stream` feature, and the stub HTTP server for `OllamaEngine`. Unlike under D6,
that scaffolding now underpins an engine in active use.

`StreamKind::Native` gains real implementors, so the tension D6 recorded — a
two-variant enum with one reachable variant — resolves on its own.

§4 (mid-stream failure) and §5's Ollama bullet become reachable and in scope.
§6 stays specified-but-unbuilt by choice, not by absence of a capable engine;
both new engines can serve it, and it lands as a follow-up.

### D8 — llama.cpp runs in-process, behind an off-by-default feature

llama.cpp is integrated through Rust bindings executing weights in the daemon
process, not through `llama-server` over HTTP.

This amends ADR 003's central decision, "the daemon never executes model
weights in-process," and sits against two further records: `DEPENDENCIES.md`
excludes a dynamic native plugin loader and states third-party code runs "as
separate subprocesses ... rather than as loaded native code," and `install.sh`
is a cargo-only source distribution that would otherwise require a C++
toolchain, plus CUDA or Metal for acceleration.

It also forfeits crash isolation. `WeightcEngine` survives a dead child and
respawns lazily, a behaviour under test as
`child_death_fails_the_turn_and_the_next_request_respawns`. An in-process
segfault instead terminates a daemon that is also hosting wasmtime archives,
files, applications, and the registry. No equivalent recovery is available.

Those costs are accepted deliberately, and contained by compiling the engine
behind a `llamacpp` Cargo feature that is **off by default**, following the
existing `bdd` feature pattern. The default build stays pure-Rust, cargo-only,
and ADR 003 compliant; the amendment applies only to opt-in builds. Selecting
`engine = "llamacpp"` in a build without the feature is a typed configuration
error naming the required feature.

Two properties argue for the choice. Owning the tokenizer makes token counts
exactly measurable rather than parsed from a remote server's self-report, which
strengthens D2. And native streaming needs no HTTP stub, since deltas arrive
directly from the decode loop.

### D9 — `uor-r4` is a first-party in-process engine over `.holo` v4 archives

`uor-r4` is not a new identifier. It is already the engine tag written into
`.holo` v4 `InferenceModel` layers — `Layer::inference_model(κ, "ai.default",
"uor-r4")` — and surfaced as `engine` on the verified application directory and
over gRPC. ADR 009 reserved exactly this work: "A future adapter may connect
that facade to Live's chat and OpenAI/Ollama surfaces."

The engine depends on the sibling `uor-r4` crates directly and executes the
bundle in-process. It is pure Rust, so unlike D8 it adds no C++ toolchain and
no change to the source-distribution story; a pinned-`rev` git dependency
matches how `uor-hologram` is already consumed. D8's amendment of ADR 003 still
covers it, as does D8's loss of crash isolation.

It is compiled behind a `uor-r4` Cargo feature, off by default, on the same
reasoning as D8: the default build stays ADR 003 compliant, and enabling it by
default later is a reversible decision in a way that the reverse is not.

Three properties distinguish it from the other four engines:

- **Model identity is a κ, not a path or tag.** `default_model = "blake3:…"` is
  already the convention `weightc` uses, but here the κ resolves to an imported
  `.holo` v4 archive through the existing verify and cache machinery rather
  than to a directory on disk.
- **Model and service are separate axes.** The layer carries an `entry` service
  name such as `ai.default`. It is derived from the archive when exactly one
  `InferenceModel` layer is present and must be named explicitly otherwise,
  failing close to the boundary rather than picking one.
- **Engine compatibility is checked, not assumed.** ADR 009 requires the
  provider to "enforce bundle and engine compatibility," so the engine verifies
  the layer's `aux` equals `uor-r4` before executing and returns a typed error
  when it does not.

**Scope boundary.** This connects the provider to the *inference* boundary:
chat and both compatibility surfaces. ADR 009 also makes `hologram run` and
resident load return `LIVE_CAPABILITY_MISSING` for model archives; those
application-runtime paths are **not** connected here and keep that behaviour.
The ADR 009 update must say which surfaces are live, or the capability error
becomes ambiguous about what is missing.

## §2 Engine boundary

Approach: additive. A defaulted capability predicate plus an overridable
method, matching how `supports_sessions()` already handles heterogeneous
capability on this same trait.

```rust
pub enum StreamKind { Native, Buffered }

pub struct TokenUsage {
    pub prompt_tokens: u64,
    pub completion_tokens: u64,
}

pub struct CompletionSummary {
    pub model: String,
    pub usage: Option<TokenUsage>,
    pub tokens_per_second: Option<f64>,
    pub elapsed_millis: u64,
}

pub enum CompletionEvent {
    Delta(String),
    Done(CompletionSummary),
}

pub type CompletionStream =
    Pin<Box<dyn Stream<Item = Result<CompletionEvent>> + Send>>;

// added to InferenceEngine:
fn stream_kind(&self) -> StreamKind { StreamKind::Buffered }

async fn complete_stream(&self, request: CompletionRequest)
    -> Result<CompletionStream>
{
    // default: await complete(), then yield Delta(text), Done(summary)
}
```

`Stream` comes from `tokio_stream`, already a direct dependency, so the
boundary adds no new crate. `Completion` gains `usage: Option<TokenUsage>`.
`complete()` itself is unchanged and remains the path for `stream: false`
requests; `complete_stream` is strictly additive.

`OllamaEngine` and the llama.cpp engine override these members; `echo` and
both `weightc` paths use the default. `EchoEngine` and both `weightc`
paths are untouched and inherit emulation, which is why the well-tested
resident session actor — where a turn is a single kameo `ask` returning one
`TurnOutcome` — needs no rework.

The buffered default awaits the entire completion before returning the stream,
so failures on those engines surface as a normal JSON error with the correct
status code rather than a half-open SSE stream. The native path cannot offer
that guarantee; see §4.

Rejected alternatives: making `complete_stream` the sole primitive with
`complete` collecting it (forces a stream abstraction onto the actor path for
no behavioural gain), and emulating inside the compat modules with no trait
change (structurally cannot reach Ollama's native stream, and duplicates
chunking across both modules).

## §3 Wire formats

Both surfaces derive the `x-hologram-stream` header from `stream_kind()` rather
than setting it per module.

**OpenAI — `text/event-stream`**

```
data: {"id":…,"object":"chat.completion.chunk","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant"},"finish_reason":null}]}
data: {…,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"…"},"finish_reason":null}]}
data: {…,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
data: [DONE]
```

`stream_options: {include_usage: true}` is supported: when requested and both
counts are known, a usage-bearing chunk with empty `choices` precedes `[DONE]`.
This is the only standard way a streaming client obtains counts, so it is what
makes §5 reachable while streaming. When counts are unknown the field is
omitted, per D3.

**Ollama — `application/x-ndjson`**

```
{"model":…,"created_at":…,"response":"…","done":false}
{"model":…,"created_at":…,"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","eval_count":42,"prompt_eval_count":18}
```

`/api/chat` substitutes `{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"…"}}` for
`response`. Count fields are omitted from the terminal line when unknown.

## §4 Mid-stream failure

Applies to the native path only; buffered engines fail before the response
starts. Once bytes are on the wire the status is already 200, so in-band
delivery is the only honest option: SSE emits one `data:` event carrying the
surface's error envelope followed by `[DONE]`; NDJSON emits one
`{"error": "…"}` line. The stream then terminates.

## §5 Token usage plumbing

- **Ollama** — parse `prompt_eval_count` alongside the already-parsed `eval_count` (today `eval_count` is read only to
  derive a rate, then discarded), and extract usage for the streaming and
  non-streaming paths through one shared function, since `OllamaEngine` will
  hit the same endpoint with different `stream` flags. That shared parse is
  what keeps the two from drifting.
- **weightc** — add optional `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` to
  `WeightcAskOutput` and `SessionLine`. Both parsers already ignore unknown
  fields, so this requires no coordination with the external CLI: the fields
  are absent today and are picked up automatically if the CLI ever emits them.
- **echo** — always `None`.

`echo` never reports counts and `weightc` does not emit the fields yet, so on
those two the key is simply absent where three nulls stand today.

`reqwest` gains the `stream` feature so `OllamaEngine` can call
`.bytes_stream()`.

## §6 Embeddings — specified, not implemented

Same idiom as §2:

```rust
fn supports_embeddings(&self) -> bool { false }

async fn embed(&self, request: EmbeddingRequest) -> Result<Embeddings> {
    Err(LiveError::Capability(…))
}
```

A separate `EmbeddingEngine` trait was considered and declined: it would force
a second construction path through `engine_from_config` for no isolation gain.

**`POST /v1/embeddings`**

Request: `{model, input: string | string[], encoding_format: "float" |
"base64", dimensions?}`. Response: `{object: "list", data: [{object:
"embedding", index, embedding}], model, usage}`. `base64` encodes
little-endian `f32` values, which some OpenAI SDK versions request by default.
`usage` follows D3.

Per engine: Ollama implements it via `POST /api/embed` (`{"model", "input"}` →
`{"embeddings": [[…]]}`); `weightc` and `echo` return the capability error.
Under D7 several engines can serve it, so this stays specified-but-unbuilt by
choice of scope rather than for want of a capable engine.

**No emulation here.** Unlike arrival scheduling, a synthesized vector is
fabricated *data*, so D1 does not extend to embeddings and D2 governs instead.

New config key `inference.embedding_model`, because the chat default model is
usually not an embedding model.

## §7 Testing

`OllamaEngine` has no tests today. D7 restores the stub HTTP server, which
gates its native path and should land early. It adds no dev-dependency:
`axum` is already a primary dependency, so the stub binds a `TcpListener` on
port 0 and serves a `Router` directly.

Both in-process engines share a harder problem: exercising them needs real
weights. llama.cpp needs a GGUF file; `uor-r4` needs a `.holo` v4 archive
carrying an `InferenceModel` layer, which only `hologram-ai` can produce, so
sourcing that fixture is a dependency on a sibling project and should be
confirmed early rather than discovered late.

Tests for both are gated on their Cargo feature and on a fixture path resolved
from an env var, skipping when absent, so the default `cargo test` run stays
weight-free. CI runs the gated jobs separately. The consequence — the default
suite never covers either in-process engine — is an accepted cost of D8/D9 and
belongs in the ADR.

The parts of `uor-r4` that need no weights should be tested unconditionally:
κ resolution, the `aux` engine-compatibility check, service-entry derivation,
and the ambiguous-entry failure.

Coverage to add:

- buffered default yields exactly `Delta` then `Done`
- native path parses a fixture NDJSON body into ordered events
- chunk sequencing and `[DONE]` ordering, per surface
- `x-hologram-stream` reflects `stream_kind()` for both values
- usage present when both counts are known, key absent otherwise
- `stream_options.include_usage` chunk shape, both known and unknown
- mid-stream error shape on both surfaces
- `engine = "llamacpp"` or `"uor-r4"` without the feature compiled is a typed
  config error naming the missing feature
- every existing non-streaming test stays green, with one deliberate
  exception: the two tests asserting that `stream: true` is rejected
  (`stream_true_is_rejected` in each module) invert to assert a stream is
  returned. They are the regression guard for D1 and must be rewritten,
  not deleted.

The compatibility surfaces have no BDD coverage under `features/`; this design
does not add any.

## §8 Documentation

- New **ADR 022** recording D1–D5 and D7 (streaming and usage). 021 is the
  current highest.
- New **ADR 023** recording D8 and D9, amending ADR 003's "never executes model
  weights in-process" decision and scoping the amendment to opt-in builds.
- **ADR 009** update: it currently mandates `LIVE_CAPABILITY_MISSING` until a
  provider is connected. It must record that the provider is now connected to
  chat and the compatibility surfaces, and that `hologram run` and resident
  load deliberately still return that error, so the remaining capability error
  stays unambiguous.
- `DEPENDENCIES.md` gains the `llamacpp` and `uor-r4` optional dependencies and
  a note that its "not as loaded native code" rule now has feature-gated
  exceptions.
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` and the README install section document the
  C++ toolchain requirement for `--features llamacpp`.
- README engine list and `live.toml` sample gain `llamacpp` and `uor-r4` with
  their keys; `config.rs` validation currently rejects anything but echo,
  weightc, or ollama.
- `README.md` lists "inference-model provider invocation" as future work; that
  claim changes for the chat and compatibility surfaces only.
- ADR 003's closing consequence calls streaming a "deliberate fast-follow" and
  needs updating.
- `README.md` "Inference compatibility APIs" states streaming is rejected.
- `ACTUAL_CAPABILITIES.md` describes both surfaces as non-streaming.
- The module table in `README.md` labels `openai-compat` non-streaming.
- Both modules' `//!` headers and their `utoipa` tag descriptions say
  "non-streaming subset".
- Regenerate `apps/docs/public/openapi.json` via `just docs`; it currently
  declares `usage` required.

## §9 Module extraction

`src/inference.rs` is 1,264 lines holding the trait, three engines, the resident
session actor, and its tests. A fourth engine pushes it past 1,500. It splits:

```
src/inference/
  mod.rs          trait, shared types, engine_from_config, re-exports
  echo.rs
  ollama.rs
  llamacpp.rs     #[cfg(feature = "llamacpp")]
  uor_r4.rs       #[cfg(feature = "uor-r4")]
  weightc/
    mod.rs        WeightcEngine
    session.rs    WeightcSessionActor, SessionTable
```

`engine_from_config` gains `llamacpp` and `uor-r4` arms; `config.rs` validation
currently accepts only echo, weightc, and ollama and rejects everything else.

`mod.rs` re-exports the shared types, so existing call sites importing
`crate::inference::{CompletionRequest, InferenceEngine}` — both compat modules
and `chat` — are unchanged. This is a file move, not an interface change; each
engine's tests move with it.

The trait keeps its current shape: three defaulted capability predicates
(`supports_sessions`, `stream_kind`, `supports_embeddings`) rather than a
returned capabilities struct. Consolidating them was considered and declined as
a wider blast radius than this work justifies.

## §10 The llama.cpp engine

Compiled only under the `llamacpp` feature (D8).

**Runtime placement.** Decode is blocking CPU/GPU work and must never run on the
runtime that serves every other HTTP route. Each context owns a dedicated
thread; the async trait methods communicate with it over bounded channels, so
backpressure is explicit rather than an unbounded queue of decode requests.

**Sessions.** A llama.cpp context is stateful — it holds a KV cache — which is
the same shape as `weightc`'s resident sessions. The engine reports
`supports_sessions() = true` and reuses the existing kameo session-actor and
LRU pattern, including `max_resident_sessions`. This is the main reuse win of
extracting `weightc/session.rs`: the eviction and lifecycle logic is already
written and tested.

**Streaming.** `stream_kind() = Native`. The decode loop forwards each detokenized
piece into an mpsc channel that `complete_stream` adapts into a
`CompletionStream`. No HTTP stub is involved.

**Usage.** Exact, not parsed: the tokenizer is in-process, so `prompt_tokens` is
the encoded prompt length and `completion_tokens` is the decoded count. This is
the only engine that can always satisfy D3's both-counts-known rule.

**Models.** The catalog currently holds `.wcpu` directories and blake3 digests.
GGUF is a single file with different metadata, so catalog support for it is a
prerequisite, not a detail — sizing this is the first task in the plan.

**Config.** `engine = "llamacpp"` plus a model path, `n_ctx`, and
`n_gpu_layers`. Selecting it in a build without the feature is a typed
configuration error naming the missing feature, consistent with how an
unconfigured engine already fails.

**Deferred.** Embeddings (§6), which llama.cpp can serve, lands with the
follow-up rather than here.

## §11 The `uor-r4` engine

Compiled only under the `uor-r4` feature (D9).

**Model resolution.** `default_model` is a `blake3:` κ naming an imported
`.holo` v4 archive. The engine resolves it through the existing archive verify
and cache path, locates the `InferenceModel` layer, checks `aux == "uor-r4"`,
and loads the opaque bundle at `content`. A κ that resolves to an archive
without an `InferenceModel` layer, or one tagged for a different engine, is a
typed error naming both the service and the engine — the same shape ADR 009
already mandates for the unconnected case.

**Service entry.** Derived from the archive when it holds exactly one
`InferenceModel` layer. With more than one, `inference.service_entry` must name
it explicitly; absent that, the engine fails rather than choosing. This mirrors
how the daemon already refuses to synthesize unknown state.

**Model listing.** `list_models` enumerates imported model archives from the
catalog, reporting the κ as id and the `entry` as name, so both compat surfaces
list them without a third code path.

**Sessions.** ADR 009 requires a provider to "preserve model-session lifecycle
semantics." The engine reports `supports_sessions() = true` and reuses the
kameo session actor and LRU extracted in §9, sharing `max_resident_sessions`
with `weightc` and llama.cpp.

**Runtime placement.** As with §10, decode is blocking work on a dedicated
thread per context, reached over bounded channels, never on the runtime serving
HTTP.

**Streaming and usage.** `stream_kind() = Native`, with deltas forwarded from
the decode loop. Token counts are exact, since the tokenizer is in-process.

**Dependency.** A pinned-`rev` git dependency on the sibling `uor-r4`
workspace, matching how `uor-hologram` is consumed today. `DEPENDENCIES.md`
gains the entry and records that it is feature-gated.

## §12 Sequencing note

This landing now covers a module extraction, a boundary change, two wire
formats across two surfaces, and two new in-process engines. That is more than
one reviewable change. The implementation plan should stage it so each stage is
independently green — module extraction first as a pure move, then the boundary
and streaming, then the engines — rather than treating it as a single commit.
