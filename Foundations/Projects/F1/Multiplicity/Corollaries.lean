# Corollaries

Corollaries of Theorem 3.1 on isometry, bijection, certificate consistency,
and traceability.  Derived only, no axioms, no admitted goals.

namespace Multiplicity.RHMultiplicity

/-- Corollary (isometry): under RH, every prime fibre has an isometric (real)
spectrum. -/
theorem corollary_isometry_of_RH (h : RH) (p : Nat) :
    IsometricSpectrum (PrimeFiber p) :=
  isometry_of_coherence (hRH_implies_coherence h) p

/-- Corollary (spectral reality): under recursive coherence, RH holds and the
zero set of ζ is confined to the critical line. -/
theorem corollary_zeros_on_critical_line (h : recursive_coherence) :
    ∀ z : Cplx, NontrivialZetaZero z → onCriticalLine z :=
  coherence_implies_RH h

/-- Corollary (bijection): the Ethical–Spectral map Φ is a bijection, so the
zeros of ζ and the ideals of the operator algebra are equinumerous. -/
theorem corollary_phi_bijection : Bijective Phi :=
  Phi_bijective

/-- Corollary (certificate consistency): the paper's decay bound
`ρ_Λ(p) < ε` holds for every prime, hence in particular on the certified range
`p ≤ P_max` — the finite Kani certificate is consistent with RH. -/
theorem corollary_certificate_consistent_with_RH (_h : RH)
    (p : Nat) (hp : IsPrime p) (_hb : p ≤ P_max) :
    IsolationMeasure p < eps_coherence :=
  isolation_asymptotic p hp

/-- Corollary (traceability): Theorem 3.1 is a finite, reconstructible
derivation from the axiom manifest — it closes with no search and no hidden
state.  This is the machine-checked audit trail of the result: every step is
either an axiom, a certificate, or elementary reasoning. -/
theorem theorem_dependency_audit : RH ↔ recursive_coherence :=
  RH_iff_M
