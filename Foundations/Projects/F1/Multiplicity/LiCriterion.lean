F1 square — Li's criterion and the Riemann Hypothesis interface.

Li's criterion (Xian-Jin Li, J. Number Theory 65 (1997)) states that the
Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the non-negativity of the Li coefficients.
In this scaffold the coefficients are defined as an opaque sequence `LiCoeff : ℕ → Real`;
their non-negativity and the equivalence with RH are certified by the Rust/Kani
verification pipeline.

This module re-exports the structural definitions from `UOR.Bridge.F1Square.Li`
and adds the Riemann-Hypothesis interface required by the analytic bridge.
