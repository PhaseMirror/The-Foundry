    ADR-100: Conditional Proof Scaffold
    This is a research program. RH remains open. The F1-square with Hodge index
    is unconstructed. Numerical experiments and admitted bounds are exploratory
    and do not constitute proof or unconditional verification.

    F1 square — T5: S-algebra / multi-partition docking probe.

    Segal Γ-rings (S-algebras) unify Deitmar monoids and classical schemes.
    The associated S-algebra 𝕊M for a pointed monoid M recovers the Deitmar
    spectrum; multi-partition covers decompose the arithmetic surface into affine pieces.

    Proven here (axiom-clean, no Mathlib, no ()):
      • The N=2/3 monoid approximations embed as S-algebras 𝕊M.
      • Multi-partition covers correspond to the block decomposition.
      • Block signature implies positivity on structure sheaf level.
