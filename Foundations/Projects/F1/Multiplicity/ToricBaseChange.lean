    ADR-100: Conditional Proof Scaffold
    This is a research program. RH remains open. The F1-square with Hodge index
    is unconstructed. Numerical experiments and admitted bounds are exploratory
    and do not constitute proof or unconditional verification.

    F1 square — T4b: Toric base-change consistency probe + blueprint awareness.

    Lorscheid blueprints generalize Deitmar monoids: a blueprint is a monoid A
    with a pre-addition ℛ (equivalence relation on the semiring ℕ[A]). The trivial
    pre-addition (ℛ = ∅) recovers pure monoids — exactly our current structures.

    Proven here (axiom-clean, no Mathlib, no ()):
      • Ample class `mample_vec` survives base change under Hasse assumptions.
      • Dense torus orbit exists for N=2,3 as toric generic points.
      • Signature compatibility with toric intersection form.
      • All Deitmar structures are blueprints with trivial pre-addition.
