# Axiom-consistency tests

Positive and intentional-failure tests of the formal model.  The
intentional-failure test cannot be *built* (by design): it is the textual
argument of the honesty gate in `scripts/run_all_kani.sh`, which asserts that
admitted-goal candidate smuggled past the axiom manifest is detected.

This is the property-based shape of the pipeline: quantify the certificate
hypothesis and discharge it once. -/
