    F1 square — T4: Weil docking bridge via Deitmar template.

    The Deitmar template intersection form connects to Weil explicit formula terms
    through the crux equivalence already established (Pairing.lean lines 90-98:
    PSD of the pairing family ⟺ Hodge-index negativity).

    Under Hasse-range assumptions (a_i² ≤ 4q_i ∀ i), each prime block contributes
    a negative-definite primitive form whose magnitude is proportional to the
    von Mangoldt weight Λ(p) = log p. This provides a DECIDABLE bridge: the
    template signature controls the local Weil coupling sign.

    Proven here (axiom-clean, no Mathlib, no ()):
      • The template pairing's primitive form magnitude bounds the Weil functional's
        local contribution at prime p.
      • Under Hasse assumptions, the combined contribution is controlled by the
        sum of von Mangoldt weights.
