# Kani certificate-consistency tests

Re-proves in Lean the exact bounds that the Rust/Kani harnesses verify on the
same models, so the certificates in `KaniCertificates.lean` and the model
axioms agree.  These are the property-based tests of the pipeline: quantified
over the whole finite domain, discharged by `native_decide`.
