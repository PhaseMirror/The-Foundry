   ADR-100: Conditional Proof Scaffold
   This is a research program. RH remains open. The F1-square with Hodge index
   is unconstructed. Numerical experiments and admitted bounds are exploratory
   and do not constitute proof or unconditional verification.
   ===========================================================================
   F1 square — the Deitmar monoid product candidate test (T3 step).

   `DeitmarTest N` is the decidable predicate that checks whether the finite
   Deitmar monoid product truncation (the discrete approximation to the
   arithmetic square) satisfies the T3 signature requirement:
     signature = (1, rankNS - 1) on the primitive complement of H.

   Verified here (axiom-clean, no Mathlib, no ()):
     • For N = 1, the single-prime template with Hasse-satisfying parameters
       passes the signature test (reduction to IntersectionTemplate.t1_signature_hasse).
     • The test is structurally decidable for any finite N.

   Open / conditional here:
     • The full N-prime block-diagonalization signature proof is the open T3
       sub-task for N > 1 (the N=1 case anchors the base).
