F1 square — v0.18.0 stage D, brick 2: the **Bombieri–Lagarias decomposition of `λ₂`**, and the
two-slice realization of the `Li.LiDecomposition` interface.

The Bombieri–Lagarias route (J. Number Theory 77 (1999), via the Guinand–Weil explicit formula)
splits every Li coefficient into an arithmetic (finite-place) and an archimedean part,
`λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}`. The ARITHMETIC part has the verified finite binomial form

    λₙ^{arith} = −Σ_{j=1}^{n} C(n,j)·η_{j−1},

with `η_j` the Laurent coefficients of `−ζ′/ζ` at `s = 1` — constructible from `Λ` alone, with
the finite algebraic recursion `ηₙ = −(n+1)γₙ − Σ ηₖγ_{n−k−1}` tying them to the Stieltjes `γⱼ`
(Coffey, J. Comp. Appl. Math. 166 (2004); Maslanka, arXiv math/0406312). ⚠ CONVENTION (pinned):
this file uses the STANDARD Stieltjes convention, in which `η₀ = −γ` and `η₁ = γ² + 2γ₁` with
`γ₁ ≈ −0.0728` — Maslanka's raw-Laurent convention flips the `γ₁` sign (his `+2γ₁` = standard
`−2γ₁`); transcribing literature formulas without pinning the convention is the dominant error
mode here. The general-`n` closed form of the ARCHIMEDEAN part (a `ζ(j)`-binomial sum plus a
linear term) appears in Coffey (arXiv math-ph/0505052, Thm 1) but its exact general shape is
not independently verified — the instances used in this file are the `n = 1, 2` cases, each
independently verified (the `n = 2` total below reproduces the closed form
`λ₂ = 1 + γ − γ² − 2γ₁ − log 4π + ¾ζ(2) ≈ 0.0923457`, re-checked to 30 digits against
Keiper 1992 / Coffey 2005). At `n = 2`:

    λ₂^{arith} = −(2η₀ + η₁) = 2γ − (γ² + 2γ₁)        (the prime side, via the Stieltjes γ₁),
    λ₂^{∞}     = (1 − γ) − log 4π + ¾·ζ(2)            (the Γ-factor place),

and their sum is exactly the v0.16.0 `Rlambda2 = 1 + γ − γ² − 2γ₁ − log 4π + ¾·ζ(2)` —
proved below as a constructive-real identity (`Rlambda2_decomposition`), extending the v0.15.3
`n = 1` split (`λ₁ = γ + (1 − γ/2 − ½·log 4π)`, `Analysis/LiOne.lean`). The sequence-level
interface `Li.LiDecomposition` is then realized with BOTH genuine slices
(`li_decomposition_two_realized`), and both slices are certified positive
(`liTwo_evidence`) — the deepest genuine realization of the interface to date.

HONEST SCOPE: the `n = 1, 2` slices are genuine; for `n ≥ 3` the sequences fall back to the
trivial split (the higher `η_j` need the higher Stieltjes constants `γ₂, …`, not yet built).
Nothing here bears on `λₙ > 0 ∀ n` — that is RH and stays OPEN.
