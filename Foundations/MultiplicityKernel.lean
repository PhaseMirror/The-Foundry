# Multiplicity Kernel — Core Doctrine (ADR-0001, ADR-0000)

Mirror of `ADR-0001 — Verified Mathematical Foundation` and the
`ADR-0000 — Verification Doctrine` described at the end of that record.

## The three-form principle (ADR-0001 "Architectural Principle")

Every mathematical object exists in three forms:

```
Definition  ->  Lean Specification  ->  Rust Implementation  ->  Kani Verification
```

Nothing is accepted until all three agree.  In this kernel each accepted
statement is packaged as a `FormWitness`: a Lean proposition, a proof of it,
and references (strings) to the Rust function, the Kani harness and the
deterministic regression vector that implement the same statement.  The type
`FormWitness` is **inhabitable only with a real proof term**, so the doctrine
"No placeholder policy" (`-- TODO: replace sorry` / `admit` / `axiom`) is enforced
*structurally*: a `FormWitness` for a proposition `P` contains a value
`proof : P`, which no `-- TODO: replace sorry` can produce in a checked module.

## Trusted base (ADR-0001 "Zero Trust Mathematics")

The trusted base is deliberately small:

* Lean kernel
* Rust compiler
* Kani verifier (CBMC)
* the explicitly defined statements below (there are no axioms)

No Mathlib proofs are imported; the kernel is developed on the core library
(`Init`) and the `Batteries` data layers (which are part of Lean's standard
library, not Mathlib).  Where a classical theorem (e.g. uniqueness of prime
factorization, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) is out of reach of the
core library, the kernel states the weakest equivalent form it can prove and
records the gap explicitly in a docstring — never with an axiom.

term of `P` exists.  This is the Lean-side encoding of rule 4 of ADR-0000

deterministic on its inputs.  Packaged per-form below. -/
