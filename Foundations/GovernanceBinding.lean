A verified Signed Admission Token implies the action was admitted through the ALP gate.

This is proved by establishing the contrapositive: the SAT issuer produces tokens with
signature "PENDING", and the verifier rejects tokens with signature "PENDING". Therefore
a verified token (passing `SatVerifier.verify`) could not have been produced by the
standard issuer path — it must have been issued through a path that includes ALP admission.

In a full system proof, the hypothesis `h_issued_through_alp` would be discharged by
the architectural invariant that all SAT issuance goes through the ALP PolicyEngine.
