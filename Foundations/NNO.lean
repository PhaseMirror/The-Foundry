# Conjecture: Free Closure Representation

If UC admits free objects and an iterator satisfying the recursion law,
then the free one-generator Universal Closure object is isomorphic
to the Natural Numbers Object.

Note: This is currently a conjecture. The formal proof requires
additional axioms about free objects and NNO.

class NNOConjecture (P : PartialUC Unit) where
  free_object : UC (Completion.Carrier P)
  is_nno : True

/-- The NNO property is a conjecture.

The formal proof requires:
1. Existence of free objects in UC
2. The recursion principle for UC
3. Uniqueness up to isomorphism
