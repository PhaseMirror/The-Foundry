# Governance Core — canonical ADR model integration

The retired `Foundations.ADR.*` shadow namespace (see `ADR/README.md`) was
deleted in the ADR consolidation. This module now imports the canonical
`ADR.Core` model directly; the single source of truth for the ADR structure,
`ADRStatus`, and lifecycle semantics lives in `ADR/`.

# Foundations.Governance.Core — ADR Lifecycle State Machine & Immutability Governance

Formalizes state-transitions for ADR lifecycle management (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated / Superseded),
enforcing the immutability theorem, link requirements, and non-reentrant acceptance invariants.
