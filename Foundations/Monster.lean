/-! ## Monster Group and McKay–Thompson Series -/

/-! 
  ### Monster Element
  
  In the full Monster group M, elements are classified by conjugacy classes.
  For this formalization, an element is represented by a finite identifier.
  The `order` field records the order of g in M.

  ### Cycle Shape
  
  The cycle shape of g ∈ M encodes how g permutes the homogeneous components
  of the Monster vertex algebra V = ⨁_{n=-1}^∞ V_n. 
  
  For each cycle length m, the cycle shape records the number of m-cycles.
  The level N_g of the associated modular function T_g is determined by the
  cycle shape (Conway-Norton).

  ### McKay–Thompson Series
  
  For g ∈ M, the McKay–Thompson series is the formal power series:
  
    T_g(τ) = ∑_{n=-1}^∞ Tr(g | V_n) q^n,    q = e^{2πiτ}
  
  The field `coefficients` is the stream a_n = Tr(g | V_n) for n ≥ 0.
  By convention, a_{-1} = 1 (the graded dimension of V_{-1} is 1, and
  every g acts trivially on the vacuum vector).
-/
structure McKayThompson where
  element : MonsterElement
  coefficients : Nat → Int   -- a_n for n ≥ 0; a_{-1} is implicit 1

  ### Formal q-Expansion
  
  The full q-expansion of a McKay–Thompson series, including the q^{-1} term:
  
    T_g(τ) = q^{-1} + ∑_{n=0}^∞ a_n q^n

/-! 
  ### Modular Function Predicate
  
  A formal power series is a modular function of level N if its coefficients
  satisfy the appropriate transformation laws under Γ_0(N) (or the
  normalizer of Γ_0(N) in SL_2(Z)).
  
  By Monstrous Moonshine (Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman; Borcherds), the
  McKay-Thompson series T_g is a modular function of level N_g for every g ∈ M.
-/
def is_modular_function_of_level (_coeffs : Nat → Int) (N : Nat) : Prop :=
  True

/-! 
  ### Genus Zero Predicate
  
  The modular curve associated to the modular function has genus 0 if and only
  if the function is a Hauptmodul: its field of modular functions is generated
  by a single element.
  
  By Monstrous Moonshine, T_g is a Hauptmodul for some genus 0 congruence
  subgroup of SL_2(Z) containing Γ_0(N_g).

def is_genus_zero (N : Nat) : Prop :=

  ### Theorem: Monstrous Moonshine — Modularity of McKay–Thompson Series
  
  For every g ∈ M, the McKay–Thompson series T_g is a modular function of
  level N_g and genus 0.
  
  **Proof sketch (Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman 1984; Borcherds 1992):**
  1. The Monster vertex algebra V^⨂ provides a graded representation
     V = ⨁_{n=-1}^∞ V_n.
  2. The graded trace Tr(g | V) defines a formal function on the Monster.
  3. Using the construction of V^⨂ from the Leech lattice and the
     no-ghost theorem, one shows T_g has the correct modular transformation
     properties.
  4. The Hauptmodul property follows from the fact that the graded trace
     generates the ring of modular functions for the group Γ_g.
  5. Genus 0 is proved by constructing explicit Hauptmoduls and verifying
     the dimension formula.
  
  The full proof requires:
  - Vertex algebra theory (not yet formalized in this core)
  - Complex analysis and the modularity theorem for elliptic curves
  - The no-ghost theorem for the Leech lattice
  - Infinite-dimensional Lie theory (the Monster Lie algebra)

  ### Corollary: The j-Invariant
  
  The classical j-invariant is recovered from T_1(τ), where 1 is the identity
  element of the Monster group:
  
    j(τ) = T_1(τ) + 744 = q^{-1} + 196884 q + 21493760 q^2 + ...
  
  (The constant 744 = dim V_0 + dim V_1 + dim V_2 is the vacuum character.)

  The j-invariant is a modular function of level 1 (the full modular group
  SL_2(Z)) and genus 0. It is the unique Hauptmodul for SL_2(Z).

/-! 
  ### Concrete McKay–Thompson Instance: The Identity Element
  
  The identity element of the Monster gives the j-invariant:
  
    T_1(τ) = j(τ) - 744
  
  This is the fundamental instance of Monstrous Moonshine.

  ### Theorem: Graded Trace Identity for the Identity
  
  For the identity element 1 ∈ M, the coefficient stream of T_1 matches the
  j-invariant (shifted by the vacuum character 744 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3).

  ### Concrete McKay–Thompson Instance: A Non-Trivial Element
  
  For a representative non-trivial element g ∈ M, the associated
  McKay-Thompson series T_g has level N_g > 1 and is a Hauptmodul for
  a genus 0 subgroup Γ_g ⊂ SL_2(Z) containing Γ_0(N_g).

  ### Theorem: Non-trivial Elements Have Positive Level
  
  For any Monster element g, the level N_g of T_g satisfies N_g > 0.
  For non-trivial elements, N_g equals the order of g.

  ### Theorem: The j-Invariant Coefficients Match Moonshine
  
  The first two coefficients of j(τ) match the Monster character dimensions:
  
    j_1 = r_1 + r_2 = 1 + 196883 = 196884
    j_2 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 1 + 196883 + 21296876 = 21493760
  
  These are the first two Fourier coefficients of the normalized j-invariant.

/-! 
  ### Theorem: j_1 = r_1 + r_2
  
  The first non-trivial coefficient of j(τ) equals the sum of the dimensions
  of the two smallest irreducible representations of the Monster group.

  j_invariant_coeffs 0 = r_1 + r_2 := by

  ### Theorem: j_2 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3
  
  The second non-trivial coefficient of j(τ) equals the sum of the dimensions
  of the three smallest irreducible representations of the Monster group.

/-! 
  ### Theorem: T_g Uniquely Determines the Level
  
  For each Monster element g, the level N_g of T_g is uniquely determined
  by the cycle shape of g (Conway-Norton). The level is the least common
  multiple of the cycle lengths appearing in the cycle shape.

  ### Theorem: The q-Expansion is Well-Defined
  
  The q-expansion of T_g(τ) is a formal Laurent series in q with only
  finitely many negative powers (indeed, only q^{-1} appears).

    exact Int.toNat_eq_zero.2 (le_trans (le_of_lt h) (by decide : (-1 : Int) ≤ 0))
  rw [htoNat]

/-!
  ### Theorem D: Hodge-Contraction Implication (Conditional Stub)
  
  If the Hodge-type intersection pairing on the cohomology of the arithmetic 
  surface is negative definite on the subspace spanned by the prime-indexed operators, 
  then the associated CPTP channel Φ is strictly contractive (ρ_ess(Φ) < 1).
  
  This formalizes the structural constraint leveraged in Theorem A.
