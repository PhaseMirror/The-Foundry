/--
A Partial Universal Closure system where composition and closure
are not guaranteed to be defined everywhere.
-/
structure PartialUC (X : Type u) where
  compose_p : X → X → Option X
  closure_p : X → Option X

/--
The categorical embedding (unit of the adjunction) of a partial system 
into a total, lawful Universal Closure system.
-/
class CompletionEmbedding {X Obs Def} (puc : PartialUC X) (uc : UniversalClosure X Obs Def) where
  embed_compose (x y z : X) : puc.compose_p x y = some z → uc.compose x y = z
  embed_closure (x y : X) : puc.closure_p x = some y → uc.closure x = y

/--
The binary residual `ι(x, y)` derived from the ternary associator `Δ(x, y, z)`.
It measures the minimal associativity failure across all completions `z`.
For simplicity in this discrete formulation without Mathlib colimits, 
we define it as an explicit function over the defect space.
-/
class BinaryResidual {X Obs Def} (uc : UniversalClosure X Obs Def) 
  (iota : X → X → Def) (le : Def → Def → Prop) where
  lower_bound (x y z : X) : le (iota x y) (uc.associator x y z)

/--
The Compositional Defect Theorem (Axiomatic Interface)
Asserts that the defect of a composition is bounded by the tensor product 
of the individual defects and the binary residual ι.
-/
class CompositionalDefect {X Obs Def} (uc : UniversalClosure X Obs Def)
  (iota : X → X → Def)
  (tensor : Float → Float → Def → Float) where
  composition_bound (x y : X) : 
    uc.defect (uc.compose x y) ≤ tensor (uc.defect x) (uc.defect y) (iota x y)
