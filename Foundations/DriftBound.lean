/--
The Lawful Subspace L ⊆ E.
In this model, we represent it as a closed set (e.g., a ball or a more complex invariant set).
For the PIRTM system, L is often the unit ball due to the projection operator P.

A transition preserves lawfulness if the next state remains in L.

Theorem: Drift-Bounded Lawfulness.
If the evolution map f is a contraction with fixed point x* ∈ L,
and the drift from the previous state is bounded, the system remains lawful.
Actually, the L0-003 invariant is a check on each step.
Claim: If f is contractive and dist(x, L) is small, then f(x) stays 'close' or within L.
If L is the invariant set of the contraction, then preserves_lawfulness is tautological.
More realistically: If S_t is lawful and drift is bounded, then S_{t+1} is lawful.

Formal Drift Bound Lemma:
If the system is in a state S_t and the calculated drift to S_{t+1} is ≤ 0.3,
and our contractive mapping f has L as its stable attracting set,
then the transition is certified as 'Lawful'.

The true goal of Phase 2 (DriftBound.lean):
Prove that δ(t) ≤ 0.3 is a sufficient condition for some safety property.
Hidden Assumption: The "Lawful Subspace" L is defined by topological invariants
that are preserved under small perturbations (drift).
