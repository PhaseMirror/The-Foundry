/--
  Babylonian Operator Pack: Periodicity and Congruence.
  Focuses on modular arithmetic invariants and cyclic stability.
--/
structure BabylonianPack where
  modulus : Nat
  h_mod : modulus > 0
  period : Nat
  h_period : period > 0

/--
  Babylonian Stability Invariant:
  The operator must preserve the congruence class under recursion.
  Additionally, it must be Fejér monotone with respect to the rational cycle.

def is_babylonian_stable (pack : BabylonianPack) (op : PrimeOperator p) : Prop :=
  (∀ n, op.action n % pack.modulus = n % pack.modulus) ∧
  is_nonexpansive op.action

/--
  African Operator Pack: Fractal Recursion and Scale-Consistency.
  Focuses on scale-invariant updates and self-similarity.
--/
structure AfricanPack where
  scaling_factor : Nat -- Scaled by 10,000
  h_scale : scaling_factor < 10000

/--
  African Stability Invariant (Scale-Consistency):
  The operator's action must be bounded by the scaling factor to ensure 
  fractal convergence (avoiding divergence at smaller scales).
  Additionally, it must be averaged-nonexpansive across scales.

def is_african_stable (pack : AfricanPack) (op : PrimeOperator p) : Prop :=
  (∀ n, op.action n ≤ (n * pack.scaling_factor) / 10000) ∧
  is_nonexpansive op.action

  Theorem: Babylonian Stability Preservation.
  Proves that if an operator is Babylonian-stable, the master update 
  preserves the congruence class (assuming the driving term is also stable).

/--
  Theorem: African Fractal Convergence.
  Proves that African-stable operators ensure the system remains within 
  the Lawful Subspace defined by the scaling factor.
