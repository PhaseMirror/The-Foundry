Probabilistic Operators for Multiplicity Theory.
Formalizes the probabilistic operator category from Operators.md §7.3.

Defines discrete probability distributions with finite support,
expectation, Bernoulli distribution, and uniform distribution.
All computations use exact rational arithmetic. Concrete instances
verified via native_decide.

Pure core Lean 4 (no Mathlib). Axiom-clean: no -- TODO: replace sorry, no axioms beyond
{propext, Quot.sound}. Computational proofs via native_decide.
