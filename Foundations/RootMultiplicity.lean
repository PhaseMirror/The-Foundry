# Multiplicity Kernel — Root Multiplicity (ADR-0001 Phase 1 scope)

Root multiplicity is computed by repeated Ruffini (synthetic) division by
`x - r`: every time the remainder is zero the multiplicity increases by one.
The recursion is bounded by the number of coefficients, since the
multiplicity of a non-zero polynomial cannot exceed its degree.
