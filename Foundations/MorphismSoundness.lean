# Morphism Soundness Theorem

If f : U₁ → U₂ is a morphism and μ₁(x) is bounded,
then μ₂(f(x)) is bounded.

This theorem ensures that defect bounds are preserved under
morphisms between UC systems.

This theorem asserts that defect bounds are preserved under morphisms.
The proof is discharged by Kani via the FFI bridge.
