# Fold Theory Test Harness (ADR-0032)

Run with `lake run fold_test` (or, from the repository root,
`make fold-test`).

Three test categories:

1. **Positive proofs** — the canonical histories (`history_pipeline`,
   `history_parallel`, `history_composite`) carry kernel-checked
   `Admissible` seals, and ν-values match both the direct computation and
   the disjoint-composition product law.
2. **Intentional failure cases** — `history_unlawful` (`A₂ ∘ A₇`, boundary
   gap `5 > θ*`) and `history_nested_unlawful` (unlawful inner node) are
   rejected by the closure axioms; the composite label `4` fails the
   prime-index basis; conflicting racing proposals cannot be sequenced.
   These are *type-level* rejections: no sealed registry record can even be
   constructed over an unlawful history (zero runtime escape).
3. **Property-based checks** — ∀-theorems (linear criterion, geometry
   separation, conflict irreflexivity, seal soundness) hold for *every*
   history / pair / extension / registry record; a finite enumeration
   re-checks all three example histories.

No `-- TODO: replace sorry`, no `admit`, no mathlib import — mirroring
`Multiplicity.FPES.Test` (ADR-0029).

/-! ### Property-based theorems (∀ over all fold words) -/

/-- **Property:** for every history, the recursive gate coincides with the
consecutive-pair linear scan. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem property_linear_criterion (w : FoldWord) :
    Admissible w ↔ chainMax (flatten w) ≤ thetaStar :=
  admissible_iff_chainMax w

/-- **Property:** for every pair of histories, emergent distance vanishes
exactly when the exponent profiles coincide. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem property_geometry_separation (u v : FoldWord) :
    dProfile u v = 0 ↔ ∀ p, exponents u p = exponents v p :=
  dProfile_eq_zero_iff u v

/-- **Property:** for every extension proposal, self-conflict never occurs
(no false positives in race detection). -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem property_no_self_conflict (e : Extension) : ¬ Conflicting e e :=
  no_self_conflict e

/-- **Property:** every registered ADR's seal is reconstructible from the
record itself — status transitions cannot corrupt audit trails. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem property_seal_soundness (a : RegisteredADR) : Admissible a.history :=
  seal_soundness a

/-- **Property (finite enumeration):** all three canonical histories pass
the admissibility gate. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem prop_all_examples_admissible :
    [history_pipeline, history_parallel, history_composite].all
      (fun w => decide (Admissible w)) = true := by native_decide

/-- **Property (finite enumeration):** bracketing changes the word, never
the flat prime sequence nor its multiplicity. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem prop_bracketing_invariant :
    history_pipeline ≠ history_parallel
      ∧ flatten history_pipeline = flatten history_parallel
      ∧ nu history_pipeline = nu history_parallel := by native_decide

/-! ### Bool checks (runtime-decidable mirror of the proofs) -/

  [history_pipeline, history_parallel, history_composite].all
    (fun w => decide (Admissible w))

/-- Both unlawful histories are rejected by the closure axioms. -/
def check_unlawful_rejected : Bool :=
  !decide (Admissible history_unlawful)
    && !decide (Admissible history_nested_unlawful)

/-- Non-associativity: same flat word, different trees. -/
def check_nonassociative : Bool :=
  history_pipeline != history_parallel
    && flatten history_pipeline == flatten history_parallel

/-- ν of the pipeline matches the direct arithmetic computation. -/
def check_nu_pipeline : Bool :=
  decide (nu history_pipeline = 8) && decide (nu history_parallel = 8)

/-- ν of the composite matches the disjoint-composition product law. -/
def check_nu_composite : Bool :=
  decide (nu history_composite = 16)

/-- Racing proposals A/B on base `A₃` are flagged as conflicting. -/
def check_conflict_detected : Bool :=
  decide (Conflicting proposalA proposalB)

/-- Identical proposals never conflict (no false positives). -/
def check_no_false_conflict : Bool :=
  !decide (Conflicting proposalA proposalA)

/-- Sequencing B after A's result is blocked (halt-at-T=0 discipline). -/
def check_sequencing_blocked : Bool :=
  !decide (Applies { base := Extension.result proposalA, next := proposalB.next })

/-- Proposal B is rejected outright while A applies cleanly. -/
def check_gate_asymmetry : Bool :=
  decide (Applies proposalA) && !decide (Applies proposalB)

/-- Deprecation preserves the seal on F001's history. -/
def check_seal_survives_deprecation : Bool :=
  decide (Admissible adrF001_deprecated.history)

/-- Geometry identifies same-profile histories across different bracketings. -/
def check_geometry_identification : Bool :=
  decide (dProfile history_pipeline history_parallel = 0)

/-- Geometry separates distinct profiles at distance exactly 3. -/
def check_geometry_separation : Bool :=
  decide (dProfile history_pipeline history_unlawful = 3)

/-- The contractive kernel strictly contracts towards the fixed point. -/
def check_orbit_contractive : Bool :=
  kernOrbit 40 3 == 5 && kernOrbit 40 6 == 0
