# Fold Theory Proofs — machine-checked theorems (ADR-0032)

Every `@[fold_proof]` declaration below is a Lean-kernel-checked theorem of
the Fold core.  **No `-- TODO: replace sorry`, no `admit`, no axioms**: the compiler rejects
incomplete proofs (ADR-0029 precedent: violating the contract blocks
compilation).  Core Lean only — mathlib stays out (ADR-0032 layering, per
the Phase Mirror rule established in ADR-0029).

## Theorems delivered

| Obligation (ADR-0032 §) | Theorem | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Admissibility threshold | `admissible_comp` | the compositional gate: `u ⊙ v` permitted iff both parts are sealed *and* their boundary modes respect `θ*` |
| Lawful Closure Constraints | `admissible_iff_chainMax` | closure over all binary subcompositions collapses to nearest-neighbour inspection of the flattened prime word |
| Non-Associative Composition | `bracketing_is_history` / `flat_word_forgets_bracketing` | bracketing survives flattening lossily: same prime word, different histories |
| Unique decomposition (FTA analogue) | `exponents_comp` / `nu_comp_mul` | exponent additivity; multiplicity `ν` multiplies over disjoint (coprime) supports |
| Recursive Contractivity | `foldKern_contractive` / `kern_convergence` / `orbit_stable` | strict contraction, finite convergence to the stable fixed point, stability thereafter |
| Edge case: concurrent proposals | `no_self_conflict` / `conflicting_not_mergeable` / `applies_gate` | racing extensions are detectable and cannot be sequenced lawfully |
| Emergent geometry §6 | `dProfile_comm` / `dProfile_eq_zero_iff` | `d_F` is symmetric and separates exactly distinct exponent profiles |
| Governance immutability | `seal_soundness` (Core) | deprecation/supersession never breaks an accepted ADR's seal |

## Proof sketches

All proofs are structural: induction on `FoldWord`/`List`, `by_cases`,
`simp`, `rcases`, `split`, `omega` (which understands `max`/`min`), and
`native_decide` for concrete artifacts.  The ℝ-valued hypotheses of the ADR
(`Θ* = Λ_m⁻¹` over ℝ, spectral overlap measures) are deliberately *not*
used here — see the module header of `Multiplicicy.Fold.Core` and the
ADR-0029 layering precedent. -/

      rw [lastOf_append_right (flatten_pos v)]
      exact ihv

/-! ### Linear form of the closure axiom -/

/-- `chainMax` distributes over appending two nonempty sequences: the only
new consecutive pair is the shared boundary. -/
theorem chainMax_append : ∀ (a b : List Nat), 0 < a.length → 0 < b.length →
    chainMax (a ++ b) =
      max (max (chainMax a) (chainMax b)) (gap (lastOf a) (firstOf b)) := by

              simp only [List.cons_append, chainMax, lastOf, firstOf] at *
              omega

/-- **Θ is linear:** the sup-aggregated obstruction of a history equals the
supremum of consecutive-pair gaps of its flattened prime word.  This is
what makes the Lawful Closure axiom (inspect every binary subcomposition)
decidable by a single left-to-right scan. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem defect_eq_chainMax (w : FoldWord) : defect w = chainMax (flatten w) := by
  induction w with
  | gen p => rfl
  | comp u v ihu ihv =>
      show max (max (defect u) (defect v)) (gap (lastLeaf u) (firstLeaf v))
        = chainMax (flatten u ++ flatten v)

        ← ihu, ← ihv, ← lastLeaf_eq_lastOf u, ← firstLeaf_eq_firstOf v]

/-- **Linear admissibility criterion:** a history is sealed iff every
consecutive pair of its flattened prime word respects the threshold. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem admissible_iff_chainMax (w : FoldWord) :
    Admissible w ↔ chainMax (flatten w) ≤ thetaStar := by
  unfold Admissible
  rw [defect_eq_chainMax]

/-! ### The compositional admissibility gate -/

/-- Arithmetic engine of the gate: a triple-maximum respects `t` exactly
when each component does. -/
private theorem max3_le_iff (a b c t : Nat) :
    max (max a b) c ≤ t ↔ a ≤ t ∧ b ≤ t ∧ c ≤ t := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    exact ⟨by omega, ⟨by omega, by omega⟩⟩
  · rintro ⟨h1, h2, h3⟩
    omega

/-- **The admissibility threshold, as a decision procedure** (ADR-0032 §
Lawful Closure Constraints): the composition `u ⊙ v` is *permitted to
combine* precisely when

1. `u` is itself admissible,
2. `v` is itself admissible, and
3. the boundary modes meet the pairwise law `gap (lastLeaf u) (firstLeaf v) ≤ θ*`.

This is the formal answer to the ADR's driving question: admissibility of
a sequence is decided recursively, node by node, by the threshold test
`Θ ≤ θ*` with `θ* = Λ_m − 1`. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem admissible_comp (u v : FoldWord) :
    Admissible (u ⊙ v) ↔
      Admissible u ∧ Admissible v ∧ PairAdmissible (lastLeaf u) (firstLeaf v) :=
  max3_le_iff (defect u) (defect v) (gap (lastLeaf u) (firstLeaf v)) thetaStar

/-- Irreducible generators carry no obstruction: every single-generator
history is admissible. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem admissible_gen (p : Nat) : Admissible (FoldWord.gen p) :=
  Nat.zero_le _

/-- **Subtree closure:** the admissible fragment is closed under taking
immediate subtrees — a sealed history cannot hide an unlawful
subcomposition. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem admissible_subtrees {u v : FoldWord} (h : Admissible (u ⊙ v)) :
    Admissible u ∧ Admissible v :=
  ⟨((admissible_comp u v).mp h).1, ((admissible_comp u v).mp h).2.1⟩

/-! ### Non-associativity: bracketing is history -/

/-- **Non-associative composition (proved witness):**
`(A₂ ⊙ A₃) ⊙ A₅ ≠ A₂ ⊙ (A₃ ⊙ A₅)` — the algebra deliberately refuses
re-association, so the bracketing tree encodes the sequential fold history
(ADR-0032 § Non-Associative Composition). -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem bracketing_is_history :
    (FoldWord.gen 2 ⊙ FoldWord.gen 3) ⊙ FoldWord.gen 5 ≠
      FoldWord.gen 2 ⊙ (FoldWord.gen 3 ⊙ FoldWord.gen 5) := by
  decide

/-- **Flat words forget bracketing:** the two bracketings above share the
identical flattened prime word `[2, 3, 5]` while remaining distinct
histories.  Hence the underlying prime sequence alone does *not* determine
the generative history — exactly the gap between geometry (stabilized
profile) and multiplicity (history) in ADR-0032 §5–6. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem flat_word_forgets_bracketing :
    flatten ((FoldWord.gen 2 ⊙ FoldWord.gen 3) ⊙ FoldWord.gen 5)
      = flatten (FoldWord.gen 2 ⊙ (FoldWord.gen 3 ⊙ FoldWord.gen 5)) ∧
    (FoldWord.gen 2 ⊙ FoldWord.gen 3) ⊙ FoldWord.gen 5 ≠
      FoldWord.gen 2 ⊙ (FoldWord.gen 3 ⊙ FoldWord.gen 5) :=
  ⟨rfl, bracketing_is_history⟩

/-! ### Exponent vectors (unique decomposition, arithmetic layer) -/

/-- Counting distributes over concatenation. -/
theorem countGen_append (l₁ l₂ : List Nat) (p : Nat) :
    countGen (l₁ ++ l₂) p = countGen l₁ p + countGen l₂ p := by
  induction l₁ with
  | nil => simp [countGen]
  | cons q rest ih =>
      by_cases h : q = p
      · simp only [List.cons_append, countGen, ite_eq_left h, ih]
        omega
      · simp only [List.cons_append, countGen, ite_eq_right h, ih]

/-- Absence forces a zero exponent. -/
theorem countGen_eq_zero_of_not_mem {l : List Nat} {p : Nat} (h : p ∉ l) :
    countGen l p = 0 := by
  induction l with
  | nil => rfl

      by_cases hqp : q = p
      · exact absurd (by simp [hqp]) h
      · simp [countGen, hqp, ih (fun hm => h (by simp [hm]))]

/-- **Exponent additivity:** the exponent vector of a composite history is
the sum of the exponent vectors of its factors — the monoid law that makes
`e(w)` a well-defined invariant of the decomposition
(ADR-0032 §4, unique-decomposition arithmetic layer). -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem exponents_comp (u v : FoldWord) (p : Nat) :
    exponents (u ⊙ v) p = exponents u p + exponents v p := by
  simp only [exponents, flatten, countGen_append]

/-- Exponent of a single-generator history: `1` at its own index, `0`
elsewhere. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem exponents_gen (p q : Nat) :
    exponents (FoldWord.gen p) q = if p = q then 1 else 0 := by
  by_cases h : p = q <;> simp [exponents, flatten, countGen, h]

/-! ### Arithmetic multiplicity ν (ADR-0032 §5) -/

/-- Emission rule at a mode whose remaining occurrences are exhausted:
factor `e_p + 1 = 2` here because the head contributes one occurrence. -/
theorem nuList_cons_tail_zero {p : Nat} {l : List Nat}
    (h : countGen l p = 0) : nuList (p :: l) = 2 * nuList l := by
  show (if countGen l p > 0 then nuList l
        else (countGen (p :: l) p + 1) * nuList l) = _
  rw [ite_eq_right (by rw [h]; omega)]
  have hf : countGen (p :: l) p + 1 = 2 := by simp [countGen, h]
  rw [hf]

/-- Skip rule at a mode with further occurrences ahead: the factor is
emitted later, at the mode's final occurrence. -/
theorem nuList_cons_tail_pos {p : Nat} {l : List Nat}
    (h : 0 < countGen l p) : nuList (p :: l) = nuList l := by
  show (if countGen l p > 0 then nuList l
        else (countGen (p :: l) p + 1) * nuList l) = _
  rw [ite_eq_left h]

/-- **ν multiplies over disjoint (coprime) supports:** if no mode of `l₁`
occurs in `l₂`, the divisor-like sub-history count of the concatenation is
the product of the counts — the Fundamental-Theorem-of-Arithmetic analogue
of ADR-0032 §5. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem nuList_append_mul (l₂ : List Nat) :

empty history and itself. -/

theorem nu_gen (p : Nat) : nu (FoldWord.gen p) = 2 := by
  simp [nu, nuList, countGen, flatten]

/-! ### Contractive kernel (recursive contractivity) -/

/-- The kernel is a strict contraction in the discrete order: folding never
increases a state. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem foldKern_contractive (x : Nat) : foldKern x ≤ x :=
  Nat.div_le_self x 2

/-- The kernel is monotone (discrete Lipschitz surrogate). -/
@[fold_proof]

  Nat.div_le_div_right h

/-- The stable fixed point. -/
@[fold_proof]
theorem foldKern_fixed_zero : foldKern 0 = 0 := rfl

/-- **Finite convergence:** every fold state reaches the stable fixed point
`0` in at most `x` kernel steps — recursive fold sequences are strictly
bounded, never divergent (ADR-0032 § Recursive Contractivity). -/
@[fold_proof]

/-- **Coherence as contractive stability:** once folded to the fixed point,
further folding changes nothing — `F(C) = C` (ADR-0032 §6 coherence). -/
