# Spectral contraction

Decay lemmas for the locked rate sequence `rateSq n = c n * c n` of
ADR-0034-F1 §5: `0 ≤ rateSq n < 1` for every mode, hence iterated
weights decay geometrically.

Scope note (honest): the carrier classes carry order and ring laws but
no metric/Banach structure, so "contraction" here means the algebraic
core — pointwise rate bounds and their iterates — which is what the
atlas estimates consume.

/-! ## Metric layer — iterated rates toward the attractor

The carrier carries no metric structure (see the scope note above), so the
iteration layer is expressed in the only faithful algebraic form: the
*squaring orbit* of the one-step rate,
`rateSqPow n 0 = rateSq n`, `rateSqPow n (k+1) = rateSqPow n k ^ 2`.
Squaring is chosen deliberately: the carrier's sign discipline proves
`sq_nonneg` unconditionally, so the entire orbit is simultaneously
nonnegative, bounded by the unit, and antitone — the discrete contraction
gauge the atlas estimates consume. Strictness at odd depths is deferred to
the analytic obligations of the atlas module. -/

/-- Orbit membership gauge: every iterate satisfies
`0 ≤ rateSqPow n k ≤ 1`. One induction carries both halves; the step uses
