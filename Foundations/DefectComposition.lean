# Compositional Defect Theorem

μ(x ∘ y) ≤ μ(x) ⊕ μ(y) ⊕ ι(x,y)

This theorem states that the defect of a composition is bounded by
the tensor product of the individual defects and the binary residual.

/-- Compositional defect theorem (Kani-verified).

This theorem asserts that the defect measure satisfies the composition bound.
The proof is discharged by Kani via the FFI bridge.
