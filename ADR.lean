# ADR Formal Governance Library — Entry Facade

This file is the **root module** of the `ADR` lean library (see `lakefile.lean`).
Lake requires a root module named exactly after the library; this facade
re-exports the authoritative `ADR.*` modules (single source of truth) and must
be built before any `ADR.*` consumer.

The shadow namespace `ADR.ADR.*` (legacy `adr_scaffolding` layout) is retired;
its source files are retained under `ADR/ADR/` for reference only and are
superseded by the modules imported above.
