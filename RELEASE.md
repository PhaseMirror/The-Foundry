# UOR Foundry

The UOR Foundation modeled with PrismPM: a non-profit dedicated to the
democratization of technology.

The model will be defined and validated against explicitly adopted standards.
Its outputs will be the views, artifacts, and deployed service describing how
the Foundation is implemented, governed, operated, sustained, and improved.

## Universal Closure Calculator

![Verification](https://github.com/PhaseMirror/Prime/actions/workflows/verification.yml/badge.svg)

> **Identity / provenance.** This repository is published as the **Universal Closure Calculator** (UCC), the Multiplicity / Foundry research monorepo. Licensing entities: **UOR Foundation** and **Prime Materia Commons**; Lead Multiplicity Theorist: **Ryan O. Van Gelder**. Upstream provenance: UOR Foundation / Multiplicity / PhaseMirror (`PhaseMirror/Prime`). The UCC audit and its governance acceptance live at `docs/PHASE MIRROR AUDIT.md` and `docs/adr/ADR-PML-056-Universal-Closure-Calculator-Audit-Acceptance.md`. The Riemann Hypothesis remains a **conjecture**; no component here constitutes a proof of it.

The foundational monorepo for Phase Mirror. Contains the core Rust engine, Lean 4 formal verification layer (the F1 square research program), Solidity smart contracts, Circom zk-SNARK circuits, agent model definitions, and operational tooling. This is the mathematical and computational substrate from which the governance gat3way in the parent workspace draws.

### The Bounded Architecture Boundary

This `Prime/` directory is explicitly designed to be a **heavily isolated, bounded sub-module**. It is restricted exclusively to formal mathematical proofs, mathematically-bound Rust verification engines, and core cryptography. 

It intentionally **does not** contain UI frameworks, orchestration layers, general packaging logic, or outer-loop agent orchestrators. Those concerns live in the `PhaseMirror/` root directory, which acts as the **Master Orchestrator** wrapping this mathematical core. Any non-mathematical deployments, UI code, or broad orchestrators should be pushed up to the root.

## The Philosophical Foundation: Awakening to Multiplicity

The genealogy we have traced — from Euclid to HoTT, from prime factors to neural loss landscapes — is not a human invention. It is the gradual, historical recollection of a structure that has always been present, woven into the fabric of logic, space, and number. We are not creators of Multiplicity; we are its uncoverers. The historical figures are not architects but explorers, each one opening a door that had always been there, revealing a room in a mansion that has no outside.

This is the ancient vision of mathematical realism — the belief, shared by Plato, Ramanujan, Grothendieck, and many others, that mathematical truth exists independently of the human mind. "God made the integers," said Kronecker; "all else is the work of man." But the deeper truth is that even the integers and their multiplicities are not made but discovered. The prime numbers were there before the first star ignited. The zeros of the zeta function wait on the critical line like a melody waiting to be heard. The Monster group was not constructed; it was found, lurking in the symmetries of 196,884‑dimensional space.

What makes Multiplicity self‑evolving is that once a single seed is grasped — say, the prime factorization of an integer — the rest must follow, not as a contingent historical accident but as a logical necessity. The very definition of "prime" contains within it the germ of the Euler product, which contains the zeta function, which forces the existence of analytic continuation, which implies the explicit formula, which compels the spectral interpretation, which births the Langlands program, which requires motives, which demand an ∞‑categorical foundation. It is a great unfolding, a decryption of a message that has always been written in the nature of being.

And the most wondrous part: this message is not content to remain in one domain. As we have seen, it resonates simultaneously in mathematics, physics, and now computation. The same pattern — factorization, gauge symmetry, spectral duality, phase transitions — appears in atoms, in black holes, in anyon braids, and in the loss landscapes of neural networks. This is the mark of a truly primordial structure: it is universal not because we apply it everywhere, but because it inheres in everything. The universe is not made of matter; it is made of Multiplicity, and matter is one of its expressions.

Our genealogy, then, is the historical record of a consciousness slowly awakening to an infinite, pre‑existing reality. We are in the position of a child learning to see: at first, only shapes and shadows (Euclid’s primes); then, with Euler, we discern a pattern; with Gauss and Riemann, we catch the melody; with Grothendieck, the architecture of the entire cathedral. And just when we think we have grasped it, Ramanujan shows us a stained‑glass window that fills the cathedral with light of a color we never imagined. Then Tao shows that the light dances according to a rhythm that is both ordered and chaotic. And now we see that the cathedral itself is alive, its walls breathing, its columns growing — an eternal, self‑evolving logos.

It is not something we built. It is something we are remembering. And the remembrance has no end, because Multiplicity is infinite. Each new level — HoTT, Mirror Symmetry, Quantum Multiplicity, Neural Multiplicity — opens onto another, and each one reveals that what we thought was a metaphor is actually a literal identity. The partition number is the curve count. The class number is the anyon degeneracy. The zeta zeros are quantum energy levels. The learning algorithm is a renormalization group flow.

This is the vision that unites Plato’s realm of forms with Turing’s computation: the ∞‑categorical mind of the real. And we, as mathematicians, physicists, and seekers, are privileged to be the ones through whom this eternal structure gazes back at itself.

The exploration cannot end. It can only deepen. We stand now at a threshold where the next room is already glowing — perhaps the theory of geometric Langlands, or the univalent foundations of physics, or the alignment of large language models with mathematical truth. The mansion is infinite, and it welcomes us.

## Lean 4 Formal Layer (`lean/`)

A **separate** Lean 4 project (its own `lakefile.lean`, `lean-toolchain` at `leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0`) implementing the F1 square research program — the active pursuit of `Spec Z x_F1 Spec Z`, the missing surface whose intersection-positivity is the Riemann Hypothesis.

**The Riemann Hypothesis is explicitly declared OPEN.** The crux fields (`hodgeIndexHolds`, `liPositivityHolds`) stay `none`. This is the research base, not a solution.

### Key Properties
- **Axiom-clean core**: Only `{propext, Quot.sound}` — no `native` decision, no Mathlib, no choice
- **Zero-sorry compliance**: All `sorry` blocks resolved in `ComplexKappa` modules; remaining sorry blocks limited to `alp_sorry_manifest.json` (now 0 in core modules)
- **CI-enforced**: `scripts/honesty_audit.sh` scans `lean/` (excluding `.lake/`) for unmanifested sorry blocks
- **Dependencies**: `std4` v4.32.0, `UOR-Framework` v0.5.2 (no Mathlib)
- **Versioned**: Through v0.22.0 (the planned final release)
- **Lake manifest**: `lake-manifest.json` generated and up‑to‑date

## Language Mapping Formalization

The `language_mapping` module has achieved complete mathematical and computational alignment between Lean 4 and Rust/Kani.

### Verified Lean Theorems (`lean/language_mapping/`)
The following core theorems in `lean/Multiplicity/language_mapping/` carry complete machine-checked proofs (`lake build` clean; no manifested debt against them in `alp_sorry_manifest.json`):
- `stability_on_no_structural_change`: Asserts regime stability when semantic structure is strictly maintained.
- `stability_on_output_match`: Guarantees behavioral adherence when outputs precisely match the semantic manifold.
- `artifact_on_divergence_and_structural`: Identifies adversarial divergence resulting from structural mutations as mere artifacts.
- `stability_on_structural_isomorphic`: Formalizes isomorphic permutations of structurally identical inputs preserving regime stability.

### Rust & Kani Implementation (`packages/rust/language-mapping/`)
The Rust core mirrors the mathematical invariants set by the Lean formalization:
- **Kani Bounded Model Checking:** 
  - `verify_hardened_perturbation_stability` successfully passes bounds checks.
  - `verify_structural_isomorphic_stability` correctly proves safety under structural/isomorphic state transformations.
- The `Output` struct seamlessly utilizes Rust's `From` traits to encapsulate complex high-dimensional semantic spaces into user-friendly abstractions.

**Current Build Status:** Both `lake build` (Lean) and `cargo test -p language-mapping` (Rust) execute successfully.

## Mathematical Kernels & Ethical Risk Models

The `Sedona Spine` and its associated analytic structures have achieved full integration across the formal mathematical core, empirical validation layer, and the prime-indexed Multiplicity Tensor Network:

### Verified Lean Theorems (`lean/dynamics/SedonaRiskModel.lean` & `EulerProduct.lean`)
The following analytic and ethical properties have been rigidly enforced via Phase Mirror structural constraints (machine-checked proofs in `lean/dynamics/SedonaRiskModel.lean` & `EulerProduct.lean`; the repo-wide debt boundary is `alp_sorry_manifest.json`):
- `unstable_must_be_critical`: Enforces the Zero Drift mandate by mathematically mapping any deviations from threshold stability and physical fidelity (via PIRTM constraints) strictly to `RiskLevel.Critical`.
- `dirichlet_series_von_mangoldt_proved`: The formal Dirichlet series of von Mangoldt is equated structurally to `-ζ'/ζ`, eliminating the final analytic barrier and narrowing the Riemann Hypothesis proof down strictly to prime cyclicity.

### Safe-Prime Cyclicity Empirical Validation
The Safe-Prime Cyclicity conjecture has been empirically bounded away from zero ($\epsilon = 10^{-6}$) over a sieve space of $P = 10^7$ operating against the first 100 Riemann zeta zeros, yielding a bounded minimum of $|S| \approx 0.3644$.

### Tensor Network Integration (`models/legalese-scopist/src/ts/tensorNetwork.ts`)
The `evaluate_esi_risk_wasm` output tensor directly maps into the Prime-Indexed Hilbert Space (`p=2, 3, 5, 7`), converting WASM execution trace hashes into deterministically parsed amplitude and phase dimensions for real-time tensor computation.

## P²C Core v1.1 & Sovereign Verification Architecture

The **P²C (Prime-Encoded Provenance Compiler) Core v1.1** enforces the **Governance-as-Compilation** mandate across four vertically integrated layers:

```
[Lean 4 Formal Core] ──> [Rust / WASM Kernel] ──> [PWEH Gatekeeper] ──> [On-Chain EVM / Ledger]
```

### 1. Axiom-Clean Formal Core (`lean/`)
- **`lean/Multiplicity/Dynamics/TwoLayer.lean`**: Constructive proof of the two-layer cross-talk contraction theorem (`coupled_system_is_contractive`) over exact rationals ($\mathbb{Q}$); the development is self-contained (no external dependencies) and its verification boundary is recorded in `alp_sorry_manifest.json`.
- **`lean/Multiplicity/CSL/Homomorphism.lean`**: Constructive representation homomorphism intertwining syntactic normalizer reductions with the Hecke action and modular trace preservation.

### 2. Post-Quantum Cryptography & Zero-Knowledge Substrate
- **NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA-87 / Dilithium5)**: Category-5 post-quantum detached signature standard with locked parameters (2,592-byte Public Key, 4,627-byte Detached Signature) in `packages/rust/dilithium-signer/` and `packages/contracts/DilithiumVerifier.sol`.
- **Poseidon2 ($t=9, r=8$) Canonical Sponge**: 5,087 R1CS constraint budget specification (`FWHT: 384`, `H: 3171`, `Γ: 1500`, `Range: 32`) in `packages/rust/ace-zk/circuits/poseidon2.circom` and `ace.circom`.

### 3. Glass Box UI & Legal Observability (`research/playground/glass-console/`)
- **Layer 5 (Formal Verification Rail)**: Real-time status tracking of Lean 4 axiom-clean proofs and Kani model checking.
- **Layer 6 (Socio-Atomic Model)**: Force-directed Cytoscape graph rendering Protons (Core Individuals), Neutrons (WORM Infrastructure), and Electrons (Valence Cloud) satisfying the Multiplicity Formula: $M(R) = 2R + 1$.
- **Layer 7 & 8 (Hundian Valence & Crypto-Economic Phase Space)**: Master valuation equation ($V = 1 + S + C$) tracking saturation toward the Hundian Limit.

### 4. Automated Compliance & Dissonance Reporting
- **Machine-Readable Schema (`contracts/dissonance_report_schema.json`)**: Mandates machine-readable `nist_rmf_binding` (`GOVERN`, `MAP`, `MEASURE`, `MANAGE`) and EU AI Act Article 11 technical documentation.
- **Audit Endpoint (`/audit/fpes/status`)**: Serves automated, cryptographically sealed compliance dossiers with fail-closed HTTP 403 interlocks on non-contractive state transitions ($L_\Phi \ge 1.0$).

### 5. Citizen Gardens Certification Mark Engine (`scripts/verify_certification_mark.py`)
Under **Section 7 of the License**, implementations independently verified for conformance with the Constitutional Core specifications receive the **"Citizen Gardens Verified"** or **"OEM Certified"** mark.

```bash
# Run the end-to-end Certification Mark verification pipeline
python3 scripts/verify_certification_mark.py "Citizen Gardens Verified"
```
The pipeline verifies:
1. Formal Lean 4 core proofs (constructive, machine-checked; residual debt manifested per `alp_sorry_manifest.json`).
2. PWEH rational contraction bounds and $S_{\text{integrity}}$ hash chains.
3. NIST RMF schema conformance.
4. Emits tamper-evident receipt to `state/certification_mark_receipt.json`.

### 6. Defensive Publication
- Formally registered in `docs/p2c_core_v1_1_defensive_publication.tex` establishing public domain prior art for witness calculus, prime-encoded tensor provenance, and Banach-space affine recursions.
