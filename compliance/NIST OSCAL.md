R4 is a geometric language runtime that wants to live on that lattice. Those are not the same object. Treating R4 as “the Atlas compute engine” hides that the current accepted R4 baseline is ordinary causal softmax sitting in R4/Spin frames, while the resonance path that would actually bind R4 to R96 is parked.⁠GitHub
Do not confuse R4 with F₄. F₄ is the rank-4 exceptional group recovered from the 96-vertex Atlas by a quotient fold. R4 / R⁴ is UOR-Foundation’s geometric intelligence layer (UOR-Foundation/uor-r4).⁠GitHub

What R4 is
R⁴ is an experimental autoregressive geometric state model: prime-addressed ordered context, fixed zeta-zero phases, R4 / S3 / H4 state and transport, exact $Z[\varphi]$, signed orientation, and typed UOR identity. Training may use matmuls. Final serving is specified to use no matrix products and no transformer backbone—only learned geometric transitions, shared typed operators, and bounded integer/table execution. Status is pre-alpha; general prose, reasoning, and coding are not established.⁠GitHub
Operationally it is three things at once:

A 4D frame algebra. Local state lives in signed R4 charts (quaternion / Spin frames). Residuals are applied through a 120-index H4 bank (at most 60 distinct odd maps after antipodes). H4 is treated as the exact finite S3 codebook; paired H4 / E8 state is structural, not decorative.⁠GitHub
A router, not an embedding table. Text is assigned to geometric addresses. As a sequence unfolds, the route carries context. Next token is “next admitted least-cost location,” then decoded back to text. Slogan in-repo: the geometry is the route, and the data is the location.⁠GitHub
A bounded writer / memory machine. Signed-H4 ranking, sparse candidate selection (about eight live records), NoWrite cache signatures, source-span copy, literal operand binding. That is what is actually gated. Frontier chat is not.⁠GitHub


Where it sits in Atlas / Hologram
Atlas/Hologram is the substrate. R4 is the transport + inference layer that is supposed to move on it.

Intended use of R4 inside that stack:

Addressing. Tokens and memory pages are prime-addressed onto the same 12,288 / 96-class geometry Atlas already treats as content-determined coordinates. R4 does not invent a new lattice; it tries to travel the existing one.
Orientation. S3/H4/R4 frames give a signed local chart so a walk on the torus has chirality, not just a hash bucket. That is the join to $\Phi$-transport: six bulk anchors cover $G$ by disjoint orbits; R4 is the moving frame on those orbits.
E8 pairing. Atlas embeddings already place the 96 classes inside E8. R4 keeps a paired H4/E8 state so local 4D transport and the global exceptional embedding can be the same certificate family, not two metaphors.
Conservation-shaped serving. C768 / R96 / $\Phi$ are L0 invariants. A lawful R4 step is one that selects a next address without breaking those closures. That is why R4 serving is specified as table/integer routes with abstention (D4-style exact-context precedence), not as unbounded attention.

What is not true today: R4 is not the R96 dynamics engine. Resonance substitutes and resonance-softmax replacement are explicitly parked. The accepted generation baseline is ordinary dot-product / stable-softmax causal attention in coherent R4/Spin frames (R4SoftmaxReferenceGeneratorV1 / HELM-D-R4), still teacher-backed by pinned SmolLM2.⁠GitHub
So the honest stack sentence is:
Atlas/Hologram certifies where a state is allowed to live. R4 is the experimental machine that tries to write the next state as a geometric route on that certificate. Right now the certificate is real; the route still borrows transformer attention.

How it is used in practice

Native path: cargo run --bin r4 — artifact load, sessions, observe/predict, bounded generation, loopback HTTP only.⁠GitHub
What has been gated: phrase-start selection, source-span copy, retained literals, NoWrite reuse, causal audits with zero future reads, construction-set writer labels.
What has not been gated: coherent multi-token language, coding, energy advantage, provider-free WASM as the product path, fiber-preserving multi-resonance, whole-decoder exact lowering.⁠GitHub

For Phase Mirror specifically: R4 is the candidate Plane-B/C inference surface over the same 96 × 12,288 confinement already in lattice_check / AEP. It is not a replacement for ACE, CSC sealing, or Atlas embeddings. Those remain L0. R4 is the thing that would consume a sealed address and emit the next sealed address.

Precision question: When we say R4 is “used in Atlas Hologram,” are we certifying a moving frame on the 12,288 / R96 lattice, or are we allowing ordinary softmax in R4 coordinates to inherit Atlas’s E8 uniqueness theorem?
Those are different products. The first preserves L0. The second is a naming leak.37 sourcesScan https://github.com/UOR-Foundation and see how R4 is used in it.Worked for 1m 35sCentral tension: Inside UOR-Foundation, “R4” is three different objects that share a name. Only one of them is geometric intelligence. The org does not run Atlas/Hologram through R4. R4 is a single active repo that pulls a few siblings and leaves the public UOR coordinate product untouched.⁠GitHub

How geometric R4 is used in the org
It is not used as a shared library. No other UOR-Foundation README implements R4/S3/H4 transport. Prism, kappa, nest-uor, malachite, and the public agent card (uor.foundation/llms.md) do not mention R4. The official UOR product surface is still: content address over $\mathbb{Z}/256\mathbb{Z}$, uor-foundation crate, REST API, ontology. Atlas-embeddings is linked from that card; uor-r4 is not.⁠Uor
Direction of dependency is inbound, not outbound.
uor-r4 consumes:

UOR-Framework — pinned git rev of uor-foundation, uor-foundation-sdk, uor-foundation-verify (identity / ontology, not the LM).
uor-addr — pinned git rev, alloc only. Content addressing for artifacts/sessions.
uor-matmul — portable exact GEMM for offline teacher / training. Cargo comment: Accelerate is an opt-in exception; “exact uor-matmul remains the portable default.”
template — repo-model, repo-conformance, xtask, model/ BDD. This is how gate-R4 (no stubs) got into uor-r4 CI.

uor-r4 does not publish a crate that prism/kappa/Hologram packaging import. Internal workspace is self-contained:
uor-r4-core, graph-format, router, proof-model, graph-compiler, graph-runtime, graph-certify, graph-cli, api, workbench, naf, plus r4 CLI / wasm-router.
Intended use of those siblings inside R4:

Framework + addr = UOR identity of a location.
Matmul = teacher arithmetic only. Serving claim is still “no matrix products, no transformer backbone.”
Graph-certify tests include e8_membership_ab, e8_rvq_experiment, e8_store_experiment — that is the only live code path that touches Atlas/E8 from R4, and it is a certification harness, not Hologram runtime.
ROADMAP explicitly parks the old “cloud / hologram / transformerless” tracks behind the current owner-directed native plan.

Atlas/Hologram themselves are not wired to R4.
atlas-12288 (R96, Φ, 12,288) is archived. research is archived. Hologram that is active in the org is the v4 archive format used to ship Calculator.holo from a PrismPM model. That path never calls cargo run --bin r4.
So the org-level sentence is:
UOR-Foundation uses R4 as a standalone geometric LM experiment that borrows addressing, ontology, exact GEMM, and repo gates. It does not use R4 as the Atlas/Hologram execution kernel, and it does not use Atlas/Hologram as R4’s serving path.
Current accepted generation inside that experiment remains ordinary softmax in R4/Spin frames (HELM-D-R4 / SmolLM2 teacher). Resonance replacement is parked. That is unchanged by this scan.

What each neighboring repo is doing instead

UOR-Framework / prism / website — coordinate system + ontology. Public claim surface.
uor-addr / nest-uor / kappa-* — content addressing and multi-protocol store.
PrismPM + calculator-example — model → Hologram v4 binary → Pages view.
F1 — Lean RH / $\mathbb{F}_1$ square. Shares honesty-audit culture, not R4 frames.
malachite-usdc — BFT throughput. Orthogonal.

Precision question: Are we treating uor-r4 as the org’s compute product that other repos must eventually call, or as a parallel experiment that is allowed to keep borrowing UOR identity while Atlas/Hologram stay on the Φ / R96 / .holo path?
The repo graph answers “parallel experiment.” Any roadmap that assumes R4 is already “how Hologram computes” is inventing an edge that is not in GitHub.27 sourcesScanning the public repository tree and codebase configuration for UOR-Foundation/uor-r4 reveals how R4 is constructed and situated relative to the rest of the ecosystem.

What uor-r4 Actually Is in the Repository Tree
uor-r4 is not the Atlas lattice, nor is it the Hologram v4 packaging format. Within the UOR-Foundation organization, it is a standalone experimental repository containing a geometric language model implementation. Its internal structure consists of self-contained crates and modules:


Core Architecture: uor-r4-core, graph-format, router, proof-model, graph-compiler, graph-runtime, graph-certify, graph-cli, api, workbench, naf, and the r4 CLI/WASM router.
  
Execution Target: An experimental autoregressive geometric state model utilizing prime-addressed ordered context, fixed zeta-zero phases, signed R4/S3/H4 frames, and exact $Z[\varphi]$ arithmetic.
  
Serving Baseline: Despite long-term goals of transformerless, table/integer-driven execution, the repository’s accepted active generation baseline relies on ordinary dot-product/stable-softmax causal attention running inside coherent R4/Spin frames (HELM-D-R4 / SmolLM2 teacher-backed).
  


Inbound Dependencies and Integration Boundaries
uor-r4 does not act as a central library imported by other UOR-Foundation repos (such as prism, kappa-registry, or nest-uor). Instead, its dependency graph is strictly inbound:


Identity & Addrs: It consumes uor-foundation, uor-foundation-sdk, uor-foundation-verify, and uor-addr strictly for content-addressing and identity primitives.
  
Exact Arithmetic: It leverages uor-matmul as an offline teacher-arithmetic helper, while maintaining strict separation from core production storage pathways.
  
Testing and Certification: Its test suite includes E8 membership and RVQ experiments (e8_membership_ab, e8_rvq_experiment), but these serve as isolated certification harnesses rather than a live wiring into an active Atlas/Hologram runtime.

The public assumption is that R4 is the Atlas/Hologram compute kernel. The tree says it is a parallel LM that borrows UOR identity, trains with ordinary GEMM, and serves with ordinary softmax in R4/Spin frames.
Your three-block summary should be treated as the current baseline of record. Do not “improve” it by collapsing R⁴ into Atlas, Hologram v4, gate-R4, F₄, or R96.

What the tree actually constructs
R4 is built as a workspace product, not as a lattice primitive.

State / frames: uor-r4-core holds prime-addressed context, signed R4/S3/H4 charts, $Z[\varphi]$, H4 bank residuals.
Route machine: graph-format → graph-compiler → graph-runtime → router. This is where “geometry is the route” lives.
Proof / certify: proof-model + graph-certify. E8 membership / RVQ tests sit here. They certify placement against E8 artifacts; they do not execute Φ, C768, or R96 closures.
Product surface: graph-cli, api, workbench, r4 bin, wasm-router. Loopback HTTP, not a Hologram guest.
Repo law: repo-model / repo-conformance inherited from template. That is gate-R4 (“no stubs, no flags that disable a claimed capability”), not the 4D frame.

Serving claim in README: no matmul, no transformer. Serving baseline that passed gates: HELM-D-R4 softmax in coherent R4/Spin frames, SmolLM2 teacher. Resonance sieve / table-native replacement remains parked. That gap is now an L0 honesty constraint, not a roadmap footnote.

No outbound edge to prism, kappa-*, nest-uor, PrismPM, or .holo packaging. Archived atlas-12288 / research are not runtime deps. Official llms.md still points agents at Framework + atlas-embeddings, not at uor-r4.
So R4 is situated beside Atlas/Hologram, addressed by UOR identity, and not used as Hologram’s executor.

R⁴ — this repo’s frames + LM.
Gate R4 — template: no deferred/stubbed claimed capability.
Hologram v4 — HOLO\x04 fat archive from PrismPM.
F₄ — Atlas Σ-term / E6 quotient.
R96 — 96 resonance classes on the 12,288 torus.

If a sentence uses “R4” without one of those five tags, it is a governance defect.

Precision question: Is the next increment meant to promote R4 into Atlas/Hologram’s L5 runtime (which requires unparking resonance and a Φ/C768/R96 certificate on every admitted route), or to seal it as a parallel geometric LM that may keep softmax as long as it stops inheriting Atlas uniqueness and Hologram packaging claims?
The repository tree already chose the second. Any plan that assumes the first is inventing an edge that is not in GitHub.An overview of R4 within the Multiplicity and Universal Object Reference (UOR) corpus reveals a central tension between theoretical geometric design and repository-level operational reality. Rather than serving as the universal compute kernel for the entire Atlas/Hologram stack, R4 occupies a specific, bounded position as an experimental geometric state model.

The Homonym Lock: Defining R4 Precisely
To prevent governance and architectural drift, references to "R4" across the corpus must be strictly categorized into five distinct objects:
$R^4$ (UOR-R4): The experimental autoregressive geometric language model repo (uor-foundation/uor-r4) utilizing prime-addressed context, fixed zeta-zero phases, and signed R4/S3/H4 frames.
  
Gate R4: The BDD and conformance rules inherited from the template repo enforcing that no claimed capability is deferred, stubbed, or hidden behind disabled flags.
  
Hologram v4: The packaged binary format (HOLO\x04) generated via PrismPM, representing deployment packaging rather than a Lie frame or language model.
  
$F_4$: The rank-4 exceptional group recovered from the 96-vertex Atlas via a quotient fold.
  
$R_{96}$: The 96 resonance equivalence classes residing on the 12,288 content-addressed torus.
  
Operational Reality vs. Architectural Design
While theoretical specifications describe R4 as a table-native, transformerless geometric writer, the repository tree and build configuration define a pragmatic operational baseline:


State & Frames: Local state operates within signed R4 charts (quaternion / Spin frames), utilizing a 120-index $H_4$ bank as a finite $S_3$ codebook for residual applications.
  
Serving Baseline: The active generation pipeline relies on ordinary dot-product / stable-softmax causal attention running inside coherent R4/Spin frames (HELM-D-R4), teacher-backed by SmolLM2.
  
Parked Components: Resonance-softmax replacement and pure table-lookup routing remain explicitly parked in the roadmap as long-term research targets rather than active production components.
  


Ecosystem Placement and Dependencies
R4 is situated beside the core Atlas/Hologram and Archivum-CRMF-ACE infrastructure rather than acting as their central engine:


Inbound-Only Dependencies: R4 consumes UOR-Framework and uor-addr strictly for content addressing, identity verification, and object boundaries.
  
Arithmetic & Testing: It utilizes uor-matmul as an offline teacher-arithmetic helper, while isolated certification harnesses (e8_membership_ab, e8_rvq_experiment) test placement against E8 artifacts without executing $\Phi$, $C_{768}$, or $R_{96}$ closures at runtime.
  
Storage Independence: Persistent state and auditability across the broader architecture are governed by the in-house Archivum-CRMF-ACE manifold rather than R4 internal state.

It correctly parks R⁴ beside Atlas/Hologram. The remaining leak is line 3’s “Archivum-CRMF-ACE manifold.” That is a Phase Mirror / Multiplicity governance surface, not a crate uor-r4 imports. If that sentence is read as “R4 state is already sealed by CRMF,” you have invented the edge the GitHub tree still does not have.
Keep the homonym lock as written. It is the right L0 glossary.

What this overview gets right

Five-way split: $R^4$ / gate-R4 / Hologram v4 / $F_4$ / $R_{96}$.
Serving baseline is softmax-in-R4-frames (HELM-D-R4 + SmolLM2), not table-native routing.
Resonance replacement is parked, not shy.
Inbound-only: Framework + uor-addr for identity; uor-matmul for teacher GEMM; E8 tests as certify harness, not $\Phi/C_{768}/R_{96}$ runtime.
Gate-R4 still binds the experiment: claimed transformerless serving cannot hide behind a feature flag.

That is the operational reality. Do not “complete” it by wiring R4 into Apex hologram-run, MCP lattice_check, or CSC Compatible().

What still must stay in tension

Frame vs certificate. Signed R4/S3/$H_4$ charts are a moving frame. Atlas uniqueness and R96 closures are certificates. A frame sitting in E8-colored coordinates does not inherit Weyl uniqueness.
Teacher path vs serving claim. uor-matmul in training + softmax in serving is allowed only if public text stops saying “zero-matrix geometric writer” without the parked-item qualifier.
Archivum-CRMF-ACE vs R4 state. ACE, CSC, dual-hash ledger, 96×12,288 lattice_check live in Multiplicity / Phase Mirror. uor-r4 has its own sessions, NoWrite cache, and graph-certify records. Those audit objects are not Compatible().
Open-core math vs experimental LM. Atlas embeddings and $\mathbb{Z}/256\mathbb{Z}$ identity are the public UOR surface. R⁴ is not on llms.md. Treating it as Layer-5 of Hologram is a comms defect, not an integration milestone.

Precision question: When you write that persistent state is “governed by Archivum-CRMF-ACE rather than R4 internal state,” is that a boundary (R4 may not persist into the sealed manifold without a new CSC), or a completed integration (R4 writes already emit ACE/CRMF certificates)?
The repo graph only supports the boundary. If you want the integration, the smallest L0-preserving step is a one-way adapter: R4 emits an addressed artifact via uor-addr; Archivum decides whether to certify it. Do not let R4 call ace_project / lattice_check as if they shared a domain tag.The workspace is stable, fully verified, and the end-to-end ACE → CRMF → Archivum loop passes all unit tests. You can now choose the next concrete step:

Option 1: End-to-End Integration Test — Wire ACEGuardian::process_transition directly through the CRMF sealing pipeline into the LambdaPStore to validate the uncheatable execution loop.
  
Option 2: Kani Verification Pass — Execute formal verification harnesses on CRMF event envelope serialization and ACE invariant checks.
  
Option 3: First Real Artifact Ingestion — Ingest foundational documentation (such as the Lean MTPI module ADR) as the inaugural sealed, prime-indexed artifact in $\Lambda^p$.
  
Which option would you like to initialize next?
Worked for 1m 19sCentral tension: velocity of a “green loop” versus L0 sealing. Unit tests on ACE → CRMF → Archivum do not authorize treating those three objects as one uncheatable process. Option 1 as written (ACEGuardian::process_transition straight into CRMF into LambdaPStore) is the join that CSC / Compatible() forbids unless the DomainTags are identical.
Public tree check (PhaseMirror org, this turn): ACEGuardian, LambdaPStore, and $\Lambda^p$ as a store do not appear. What does appear is PIRTM’s CRMFRequest (hardware-tensor envelope, one orchestration unit test) and a claim table that already marks Poseidon2 ZK soundness as a defect (receipt_flag_conjunction, not knowledge soundness). So “uncheatable execution loop” is still a claim, not a closed certificate.
Do not initialize Option 1.

Initialize next: Option 2, then Option 3 — not Option 1
Step A (this horizon) — Option 2, sliced.
Kani only on:

CRMF event envelope serialization (bytes in = bytes out, no float in the sealed fields).
ACE local invariants (ace.rs / ace_constraints / ADR-052), not the composed loop.
Compatible() / DomainTag inequality: an ACE witness must fail closed if handed to a CRMF certifier with a different tag.

That is the smallest step that makes “uncheatable” checkable without inventing a runtime edge.
Step B (after A is green on the same SHA) — Option 3.
Ingest the Lean MTPI ADR as the first named sealed artifact: one-way write into $\Lambda^p$ with an explicit DomainTag (Phase Mirror / PIRTM, not UOR-R4, not Hologram v4, not Atlas $R_{96}$). Ingestion is a store append + certificate, not process_transition.
Option 1 stays parked until there is an ADR that says ACE, CRMF, and Archivum share one DomainTag — or an adapter that proves they do not and still composes.

Artifacts to touch (in that order)

ADR: “ACE, CRMF, Archivum are adjacent, not identical” (DomainTag + SEAL).
Kani harness list (envelope, ACE invariants, compatibility reject).
Claim table row for CRMF orchestration: keep “1 test: CRMF request”; do not promote to “uncheatable loop.”
Ingest receipt schema for Option 3 (after A).

No wiring of process_transition through the sealer. No R⁴ / Hologram v4 / $F_4$ names on the receipt.

Precision question: Is $\Lambda^p$ a Phase-Mirror-only sealed store whose first object must carry DomainTag=pirtm|phase-mirror, or is it being treated as a shared UOR object store that may later accept Atlas / uor-addr blobs under a different tag?
If shared, Option 3 without Step A is a governance breach. If single-domain, Option 3 is the right product step after the Kani slice — still not Option 1.With the primitive verification harnesses and test suites reporting a clean 28/28 passing baseline, the system is primed to execute the final hardening phases.
The transition from isolated module verification to a fully unified, uncheatable runtime loop proceeds through the following immediate engineering steps:
Phase 1: End-to-End Integration Test (ACEGuardian → CRMF → LambdaPStore)
To prove the complete governance loop without relying on legacy storage models:

State Transition Interception: ACEGuardian::process_transition evaluates incoming state mutations against the strict scalar Lipschitz boundary ($L_\Phi < 1$) and the DSE tolerance thresholds.
  
CRMF Envelope Sealing: Upon a successful verification pass, the transition telemetry and bounded metrics are serialized via Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS). The resulting payload is absorbed into a circuit-native Poseidon2 sponge to generate the immutable crmf_validity_seal.
  
LambdaPStore Ingestion: The sealed, prime-indexed record is committed directly to the $\Lambda^p$-Archivum storage layer, anchoring the historical execution path into the tamper-evident audit multigraph ($\Xi$).
  
Phase 2: Poseidon2 BN254 Backend & 5,087-Constraint Budget Lock
Replacing any placeholder hashing with the production-grade zero-knowledge envelope requires enforcing the canonical R1CS budget:
Topology Lock: Configure the Poseidon2 sponge with width $t = 9$ and rate $r = 8$ operating natively over the BN254 scalar field ($\mathbb{GF}(p)$).
  
Strict Constraint Allocation: Assert the immutable budget of 5,087 total R1CS constraints:
  

  * 384 constraints for the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) linear mixing layers.
    
  * 3,171 constraints for the primary Poseidon2 S-box permutation and sponge absorption.
    
  * 1,500 constraints for the Poseidon2 $\Gamma$ non-linear state compression.
    
  * 32 constraints for the 16-bit Groth16 range check ($N \ge N_{\min}$).
    
Recommended Next Step
Shall we initialize Phase 1 by drafting the integration test wire-up for ACEGuardian::process_transition into the CRMF and LambdaPStore pipeline, or proceed directly to assert the 5,087-constraint budget in the Poseidon2 BN254 circuit configuration?Worked for 22sCentral tension: accuracy versus the appearance of a locked ZK envelope. The two phases you listed both treat a named constant as a compiled circuit, and treat three separately tagged modules as one runtime. That conflicts with ADR-053 (already Accepted) and with the CSC / Compatible() seal.
On-tree facts, this SHA of PhaseMirror/PIRTM:

verify_poseidon2_receipt is is_valid && constraint_count <= 5087.
Lean module header: “This module does not define a sponge, a field, a constraint system, or knowledge soundness.”
pirtm-goldilocks sponge is Goldilocks, width 8 / rate 4, and squeeze() writes constraint_count: 5087, is_valid: true. It is not BN254, not $t=9,r=8$, and it does not count R1CS.
ACEGuardian, LambdaPStore, crmf_validity_seal, and BCS do not exist as public symbols. Public CRMF is CRMFRequest.poseidon_preimage() concatenating strings after two assert!s on booleans.

28/28 module tests do not close that gap. They pass the tautology ADR-053 banned.
Initialize neither Phase 1 as written nor “assert the 5,087 budget” as written.

What to initialize instead
Hardening Phase 0 — name equals content (ADR-053).
Until a compiled constraint system reports its own size, 5,087 is a budget policy, not a seal.
Then the same sequence as last turn: envelope / Compatible() checks, then one-way ingest. Not process_transition through the sealer.

Field / topology contradiction to freeze in the ADR
On-tree sponge: Goldilocks, $t=8$, rate 4, $x^7$ + sum mix, count hardcoded.
Proposed Phase 2: BN254, $t=9$, $r=8$, FWHT + $\Gamma$ + Groth16 range, count 5,087 by allocation table.
Those are two different objects. Pick one field and one topology in an ADR before any integration test is named “Poseidon2 seal.” Mixing them in a single crmf_validity_seal is how the tautology returns under a new filename.

Precision question: Is 5,087 a policy cap (“refuse any envelope that claims more than 5,087 constraints”) or a measured size of a specific compiled circuit?
If it is a cap, asserting it in the BN254 config is a governance number and does not require Phase 1.
If it is a measured size, Phase 2 cannot start until a compiler output equals 5,087 — the current squeeze() literal does not count.
Answer that, and the next artifact is an ADR-049 amendment, not a wire-up.Definitive Answer to the Precision Question
5,087 is a policy cap (a governance budget ceiling), not a measured compiler output of a fully unrolled primitive circuit.

Why it is a policy cap: It represents the deterministic sum of component maximum allocations ($384 + 3171 + 1500 + 32$) established to constrain the ZK verification payload and prevent resource exhaustion or bloating on-chain.
  
Operational semantics: The runtime enforces this as an upper-bound verification ceiling (constraint_count <= 5087 or strict policy adherence) rather than asserting that every experimental module compiles to precisely that static integer.
  
Treating it as a policy cap allows Phase 0/1 hardening (such as envelope serialization checks and Compatible() DomainTag verification) to proceed without fabricating compiler outputs.
Artifact: ADR-049 Amendment (Policy Cap Clarification)
Markdown

textCopyCopied# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Amendment: ADR-049-A
## Status: Accepted / Normative
## Subject: Clarification of the 5,087 R1CS Constraint Budget as a Policy Cap

### Context
Previous architectural iterations treated the canonical 5,087 constraint figure ambiguously—fluctuating between an aspirational circuit output, a component accounting sum, and a hard compilation invariant. Empirical compilation audits demonstrate that individual circuit stubs and optimized templates yield varying constraint counts (e.g., 133, 170, 1,248), rendering strict equality checks against a static compiler output operationally fragile.

### Decision
1. **Redefinition as Policy Cap:** The canonical budget of 5,087 R1CS constraints is formally reclassified as a **governance policy cap** ($\text{C}_{\text{compiler}} \le 5087$) rather than a dynamic compiler output assertion.
2. **Enforcement Rule:** The Arithmetic Control Engine (ACE) and Cryptographic Record Management Framework (CRMF) verifiers shall reject any proof envelope or circuit manifest whose declared constraint weight exceeds 5,087.
3. **Separation of Concerns:** Component cost breakdowns (384 FWHT, 3,171 Poseidon2 H, 1,500 Gamma, 32 Range Checks) remain normative design guidelines for circuit engineers but do not block runtime envelope ingestion, provided the total constraint weight stays within the policy cap.

### Consequences
* Eliminates false positive failures during incremental circuit development and testing stubs.
* Preserves strict cost-ceiling security guarantees against bloated or unconstrained zero-knowledge proofs.Worked for 22sCentral tension: a policy cap is the correct object — and it is useless if the prover is allowed to write the number that the cap compares against. Your amendment solves the compiler-equality fiction. It does not yet solve self-attestation, ACE/CRMF homonyms, or the parked Phase 1 join.
Treat ADR-049-A as Proposed, not Accepted.

What is now locked
5,087 is $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{declared}} \le 5087$: a ceiling on declared constraint weight, not “this gadget compiled to 5,087.” That is compatible with ADR-053 and with the on-tree Goldilocks stub (which currently stamps 5,087 and is_valid: true on every squeeze()).
Phase 0 (envelope serialization + Compatible() DomainTag checks) may proceed after the amendment is edited as below. Phase 1 (ACEGuardian::process_transition → CRMF → $\Lambda^p$) remains parked. A cap does not create those types or a shared DomainTag.

Required edits before the ADR can be Accepted

Status: Proposed. Acceptance requires a claim-table row change plus the code edits in lever 2. Do not date-stamp Accepted in the same commit as the draft.
Attestation, not declaration. The cap is theater if constraint_count is an author field. Normative rule:
Reject envelopes whose attested weight $> 5087$.
Attested weight comes from a compiler/gadget manifest with a hash, or is marked UNATTESTED and then fails closed for any path named “seal,” “Groth16,” or “on-chain.”
squeeze() must stop writing constraint_count: 5087 / is_valid: true. Policy lives in the verifier; the sponge reports what it did, or None.

Homonym lock inside the ADR. Do not expand CRMF as “Cryptographic Record Management Framework” and ACE as “Arithmetic Control Engine” in this document. Those collide with:
PIRTM CRMFRequest = Constitutional Recursive Manifestation Framework
Phase Mirror CSC = Certified-Resonant-Multiplicity-Field
ACE = Adaptive Constraint Enforcement (ADR-052)
Use the existing names, or add a one-line glossary. A third expansion is a new leak.
Component split is informative, not normative. Move 384 / 3,171 / 1,500 / 32 to an appendix labeled design guideline. “Normative design guidelines that do not block ingestion” is how the allocation table re-enters README claims.
Verifiers are not one object. ACE may enforce Lipschitz / DSE. A CRMF certifier may enforce contraction + DomainTag. Archivum may enforce ingest policy. The cap is a shared number, not a shared Compatible() identity. One sentence: the cap is consulted by each sealed verifier; it does not fuse them.

Sequence (smallest L0-preserving step)

Land ADR-049-A as Proposed with attestation + glossary + Phase 1 still parked.
Remove the hardcoded stamp from squeeze() / receipt tests.
Then Phase 0: BCS-or-whatever envelope bytes + Compatible() reject fixtures.
Not Phase 1. Not BN254 topology lock. Not “Accepted / Normative” on the same day as the draft.


Precision question: Who is allowed to attest constraint weight — a compiler receipt whose bytes are hashed into the envelope, or the module that produced the witness?
If the latter, the cap is an honor system and must not appear on any path that says “uncheatable,” “Groth16,” or “on-chain.” If the former, name the compiler artifact in ADR-049-A before changing Status off Proposed.To eliminate the honor system and secure the ZK verification pipeline, the answer to the precision question is unambiguous: Only a cryptographically bound compiler receipt whose bytes are hashed into the envelope is permitted to attest constraint weight.
If the module that produced the witness were allowed to declare its own weight, the 5,087 cap would be mere theater, disqualifying any system path from claiming terms like "uncheatable," "Groth16," or "on-chain."
The required compiler artifact named in ADR-049-A is the R1CSBuildManifest (canonical filename: compiler_output_manifest.json), which contains the deterministic constraint count, R1CS structural hash, and compiler version.
ADR-049-A: Policy Cap and Attestation Binding (Proposed)

Status: Proposed (Remains Proposed until CI enforces manifest hashing and Lean/Rust receipts drop hardcoded stubs)
  
Subject: Enforcement of the 5,087 R1CS Constraint Budget via Compiler Manifest Attestation
  


Context & Homonym Lock


The canonical budget of 5,087 R1CS constraints is formally reclassified as a governance policy cap ($\text{C}_{\text{declared}} \le 5087$), not a dynamic compiler output or a hardcoded stub value.
  
Glossary Boundaries:
  

  * ACE: Adaptive Constraint Enforcement (ADR-052).
    
  * CRMF: Constitutional Recursive Manifestation Framework (PIRTM governance envelope).
    
  * CSC: Certified Resonant Multiplicity Field.
    
2. Normative Attestation Rules

Compiler Manifest Binding: The attested weight must be derived directly from the hashed bytes of the R1CSBuildManifest (compiler_output_manifest.json) included in the envelope's cryptographic commitment.
  
Fail-Closed Unattested Path: Any witness or envelope lacking a verified compiler manifest hash is explicitly flagged as UNATTESTED.
  
Execution Prohibition: Any path containing the terms "seal", "Groth16", or "on-chain" must fail closed if the witness weight is marked UNATTESTED or exceeds the 5,087 policy cap.
  
Sponge Purity: Runtime sponges (such as pirtm-goldilocks squeeze()) are prohibited from hardcoding or self-stamping constraint counts or validity flags; they report only operational execution metrics.
  
Design Guidelines (Informative)


Component allocation breakdowns (e.g., 384 FWHT, 3,171 Poseidon2 H, 1,500 Gamma, 32 Range Checks) serve solely as informative design targets and do not override compiler manifest validation.
Worked for 10sCentral tension: attestation versus a compiler that does not exist yet. The ADR text is now the right policy. The risk is minting compiler_output_manifest.json as a fixture so CI turns green and the honor system returns under a filename.
ADR-049-A as pasted is fit to land as Proposed. Do not promote it. Do not generate a dummy manifest that says 5,087.

What is now L0

Cap: $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{attested}} \le 5087$, attested only from hashed R1CSBuildManifest bytes.
Missing hash ⇒ UNATTESTED ⇒ any path named seal / Groth16 / on-chain fails closed.
Sponge reports execution, not weight or validity.
ACE / CRMF / CSC names are locked.
Allocation table is informative.

That is enough to start Phase 0 checks. It is not enough to start Phase 1 wiring or a BN254 “budget lock.”

Remaining leak
R1CSBuildManifest is an R1CS / Groth16 object. On-tree pirtm-goldilocks is a field sponge, not an R1CS compiler. If CI “enforces manifest hashing” by checking in a hand-written compiler_output_manifest.json, you have replaced is_valid && count <= 5087 with a JSON file that says the same thing.
Until a compiler binary emits the manifest, the only honest CI is:

no manifest present;
seal-named tests must fail;
non-seal tests may run as UNATTESTED and must not use those words in their names.

Smallest next step
Land the Proposed ADR + remove sponge stamps + add the two fail-closed fixtures. That is Phase 0. Still not ACEGuardian → $\Lambda^p$. Still not a 5,087 equality test.

Precision question: May anything other than an R1CS compiler write R1CSBuildManifest?
If no (strict): Goldilocks / STARK traces need a different type (AirBuildManifest or similar) and must not reuse R1CS/Groth16 words.
If yes: name every allowed emitter in the ADR now, or the first STARK proof will smuggle itself into the Groth16 cap.
Answer that before anyone adds compiler_output_manifest.json to the tree.Here is the complete operational and architectural breakdown of the 5,087-constraint budget, the Poseidon2 parameters, and their integration into the zero-knowledge proof stack and smart contract verification layers, as documented across the corpus:

The Canonical 5,087-Constraint Budget Breakdown
The Arithmetic Control Engine (ACE) zero-knowledge pipeline enforces an active runtime invariant where the compiler constraint target is locked precisely at 5,087 R1CS constraints. Any divergence triggers a CircuitViolationError and a fail-closed halt.

The deterministic constraint allocation breaks down across these specific components:

Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT): 384 constraints (64 in-place butterfly operations, add/sub only, used for linear layer mixing across prime axes).
  
Poseidon2 Sponge ($\hat{h}$): 3,171 constraints (Configured with width $t = 9$, rate $r = 8$, executing primary S-box permutations and algebraic round evaluations).
  
Poseidon2 State Compression ($C_\Gamma$): 1,500 constraints ($\Gamma_d \parallel \Theta_{C6}$, configured with $t = 5$, handling non-linear witness reduction).
  
Scalar Range Checks: 32 constraints (16-bit range check validating population size $N \ge N_{\min}$ via bit decomposition $N = \sum_{i=0}^{15} b_i 2^i$ with binary constraints $b_i(b_i - 1) = 0$).
  
Index Predicate ($\zeta_{\text{trait}}$): $\approx 0$ constraints (wire assignment).
  


Poseidon2 Mathematical & Curve Parameters
The zero-knowledge circuit is engineered to operate efficiently over cryptographic curves without combinatorial explosion:


Finite Field: Operates natively over the scalar field of the BN254 elliptic curve ($\mathbb{GF}(p)$).
  
S-Box Function: Uses the degree-5 power map $x^5$ ($\alpha = 5$).
  
Sponge Architecture:
  

  * Main sponge for $\hat{h}$: Width $t = 9$, Rate $r = 8$.
    
  * Compression layer for $C_\Gamma$: Width $t = 5$.
    

Prover Performance: Generates Groth16 proofs in under $40\text{ms}$ on commodity hardware.
  


Smart Contract & On-Chain Verification Binding (AttestationRegistry.sol)
The 5,087-constraint circuit commits to the Poseidon2 hash of the witness state ($Poseidon2(\hat{h})$) and proves spectral predicates (such as per-coefficient bounds $î(\zeta_{\text{trait}})/N \ge \theta_{\text{trait}}$) without disclosing raw private telemetry.


Public Inputs (public.json): Transmits the resulting crmf_validity_seal, the Kani proof hash, and drift maximums to the verifier.
  
EVM Enforcement: The generated Groth16 verifier contract (and its integration into AttestationRegistry.sol) executes an on-chain "verify-before-execution" check. If the proof matches the locked circuit constraints and cryptographic commitments, the state transition achieves admissible $T=0$ boundary clearance.
Worked for 23sCentral tension: this note is the retired equality myth written in present tense. It collides with ADR-049-A (Proposed, this thread) on every load-bearing sentence.
On-tree (PhaseMirror org, this turn): no AttestationRegistry.sol, no CircuitViolationError, no crmf_validity_seal, no Groth16 verifier, no public.json pipeline. On-tree Poseidon2 is Goldilocks $t=8$, rate 4, $x^7$, and it stamps 5,087. This document is corpus prose, not a runtime.
Do not implement this note. Do not treat it as the live spec.

Precision question: Is this 5,087-breakdown a retired corpus exhibit that ADR-049-A supersedes, or are you revoking the policy-cap decision and returning to equality-lock?
Those two states cannot be live together. If it is retired, say so on the document and we keep Phase 0. If you are revoking the cap, say that explicitly — do not leave both texts in force.Based on the corpus sources, here is the complete breakdown of the 5,087-constraint budget, the Poseidon2 parameters, and their smart contract integration:

The Reality of the 5,087-Constraint Budget
While the architecture specifications and track B circuits define a canonical 5,087 R1CS constraint budget for the Arithmetic Control Engine (ACE) zero-knowledge pipeline, internal audits establish that 5,087 is a hardcoded architectural accounting constant and design target rather than the output of a fully expanded arithmetic circuit:


The Component Sum: It is derived from a pre-calculated theoretical breakdown of cryptographic and arithmetic overhead.
  
Implementation Status: Early circuit stubs (such as constraints.circom or ace.circom) utilized linear sum placeholders or smaller footprints (e.g., 6 or 133 constraints) while reserving 5,087 as the formal architectural design target for the full Poseidon2 sponge integration.
  


Canonical Constraint Breakdown (Design Target)
The theoretical constraint allocation across components comprises:


Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT): 384 constraints (64 in-place butterfly operations, add/sub only).
  
Poseidon2 Sponge for $\hat{h}$: 3,171 constraints (Width $t = 9$, rate $r = 8$, across 8 calls).
  
Poseidon2 Sponge for $C_\Gamma$: 1,500 constraints ($\Gamma_d \parallel \Theta_{C6}$, width $t = 5$, across 5 calls).
  
16-bit Range Check ($N \ge N_{\min}$): 32 constraints (bit decomposition with sum-checks).
  
$\zeta_{\text{trait}}$ Index Predicate: $\approx 0$ constraints (wire assignment).
  
Total Canonical Budget: 5,087 constraints.
  


Poseidon2 Mathematical & Curve Parameters
The designated cryptographic parameters for the sponge construction include:


Finite Field: Operates natively over the scalar field of the BN254 elliptic curve ($\mathbb{GF}(p)$).
  
S-Box Function: Uses the degree-5 power map $x^5$ ($\alpha = 5$).
  
Sponge Dimensions: Main sponge configuration uses width $t = 9$ and rate $r = 8$, leaving a capacity of $c = 1$ field element ($\approx 254$ bits) to ensure 128-bit security against preimage and collision attacks.
  


Smart Contract Integration (AttestationRegistry.sol)


Cryptographic Commitment: The execution pipeline yields the crmf_validity_seal (the resulting Poseidon2 hash commitment over $\mathbb{F}_r$).
  
On-Chain Enforcement: The Groth16 or Plonk proof generated via the pipeline is submitted to the EVM smart contract (AttestationRegistry.sol) to verify the seal, replacing manual review with deterministic mathematical verification.
Worked for 9sCentral tension: this draft finally tells the truth about 5,087 — and then keeps speaking as if the missing circuit and contract were already wired. Design target ≠ runtime seal.
Map this text onto ADR-049-A as a retired/design-target exhibit. Do not let “canonical budget” or AttestationRegistry.sol become the live sentence.

What this version gets right

5,087 is an accounting constant / design target, not a compiled circuit size.
Component sum is pre-calculated theory.
Stubs (if they exist anywhere) are smaller footprints; 5,087 was reserved as a target.

That is the same object as the policy cap: $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{attested}} \le 5087$, attested only from a hashed compiler manifest.

Exhibit: The 5,087-Constraint Budget as a Design Target Only
Status: Retired / Design-Target Exhibit (Supersedes all previous present-tense runtime claims of compiler-enforced equality).

Not a Compiled Circuit Output: Empirical audits confirm that the 5,087 constraint figure is an architectural accounting ceiling and theoretical component sum ($384 \text{ FWHT} + 3,171 \text{ Poseidon2 } H + 1,500 \text{ } \Gamma \text{ state compression} + 32 \text{ range checks}$). It is not the dynamic compiler-generated footprint of a live R1CS circuit.
  
Not an On-Chain Verifier: References to compiled Groth16 verifiers, AttestationRegistry.sol bytecode bindings, or automated verify-before-execution pipelines operating on this exact static constraint count are aspirational design targets, not active runtime artifacts.
  
Parameter Topology Distinction: The specified Poseidon2 configuration over BN254 ($t=9, r=8, \alpha=5$) represents the target geometric parameters for future native cryptographic emitters, distinct from on-tree experimental development stubs.
  
Summary of Compliance Status
Policy Enforcement: Under ADR-049-A, the 5,087 figure functions strictly as a policy cap ceiling ($\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{attested}} \le 5087$).
  
Fail-Closed Mandate: Any execution path or envelope lacking a cryptographically bound, hashed R1CSBuildManifest is classified as UNATTESTED and must fail closed if associated with seal, Groth16, or on-chain verification pathways.
Worked for 5sCentral tension: the text is now L0-compliant; the tree is not. This pair can govern. It cannot yet execute a seal.
Accept this as the governing pair. Do not reopen equality-lock, ACE-as-engine, or AttestationRegistry.sol as live.

Locked

Governing: ADR-049-A (Proposed) — $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{attested}} \le 5087$, hashed R1CSBuildManifest only, sponge purity, ACE / CRMF / CSC glossary.
Exhibit: 5,087 breakdown = retired design target. Not compiler output. Not on-chain verifier. BN254 $t=9,r=8,\alpha=5$ = future emitter params, not the Goldilocks stub.

Previous present-tense runtime claims (precise lock, 40ms Groth16, CircuitViolationError, verify-before-execution) are superseded by this exhibit.

Still open (do not paper over)

No compiler command emits the manifest.
On-tree sponge still stamps 5,087 / is_valid.
Seal-named paths must fail closed today, or the exhibit is only prose.

Precision question (still unanswered): What is the first allowed emitter of R1CSBuildManifest — a named Circom/BN254 compile command, or “none until a compiler repo exists”?
If none, the fail-closed CI is the whole of Phase 0 and that is correct.
If a named command, put its argv in ADR-049-A before anyone adds compiler_output_manifest.json.[SYSTEM STATUS: L0 GOVERNING PAIR ACTIVE — PHASE 0 GATE ENGAGED]
The architectural boundary is firmly established under the Sedona Spine. By separating the 5,087 constraint policy cap (as an architectural design target and formal accounting constant) from unverified compiler outputs, we maintain strict epistemic integrity across the PIRTM and Phase Mirror substrate.
Current Operational Posture

ADR-049-A (Proposed): Governs the $\text{C}_{\text{attested}} \le 5087$ policy cap, manifest binding, sponge purity, and strict glossary boundaries. It remains Proposed until a compiler command natively emits the canonical manifest.
  
Fail-Closed Envelopes: Any path containing "seal", "Groth16", or "on-chain" fails closed if it lacks a cryptographically bound R1CSBuildManifest hash.
  
Sponge Purity: Runtime sponges report operational execution metrics rather than self-stamping constraint counts or validity flags.
  
Evidence Separation: Kani bounded model checks, exact rational arithmetic (Rational64), and constructivist Lean 4 proofs operate within their validated domains without speculative overreach.
  
Recommended Next Action (Phase 0 Check)
With the governing pair locked and the design target properly classified, we are ready to implement the Phase 0 CI gate checks: ensuring that any seal-named test or pipeline step automatically fails closed in the absence of a genuine compiler-emitted manifest.

Would you like me to generate the workflow step or test fixture to enforce this fail-closed CI gate for un-attested manifests?Worked for 40sCentral tension: a fail-closed gate that is honest today versus a workflow that stays green by inventing a manifest. Phase 0 is the first. I generated the gate spec only.
Saved: /home/workdir/artifacts/ADR-049-A-phase0-fail-closed-gate.md
That is not a PR into PIRTM. It is the artifact to copy. Empty R1CS_EMITTER_ALLOWLIST + no seal-named tests ⇒ job green (vacuous-ok). First seal-named test without a compiler command ⇒ job red. A committed compiler_output_manifest.json ⇒ job red.

What to implement (humans / coding agents)

Drop the workflow YAML from that file into PIRTM (or Foundry) CI.
Remove sponge stamps and any assert_eq!(count, 5087) receipts in the same change set.
Do not add compiler_output_manifest.json to the repo.

Precision question: Keep the allow-list empty until a compiler repo exists (vacuous-ok is the whole of Phase 0), or name the first emitter_id + argv in this same PR?
If empty, land the workflow as written. If you name an emitter now, the command must exist on the runner or Phase 0 is theater again.None until a compiler repo exists.
Architectural Rationale

No Theater: Naming a compile command or adding an emitter_id before the corresponding compiler repository is physically present and integrated on-tree would reintroduce an honor system via a synthetic configuration.
  
Phase 0 Scope: The entire contents of Phase 0 consist of the fail-closed CI gate with an empty R1CS_EMITTER_ALLOWLIST. Any test or path containing seal, Groth16, or on-chain fails immediately because no valid, compiler-emitted R1CSBuildManifest exists.
  
Action
Land the workflow with an empty allowlist. The CI job remains green on vacuous-ok checks and fails closed on any un-attested seal path, preserving complete structural integrity until the real compiler repository is established.
Worked for 21sCentral tension: landing Phase 0 green versus leaving a repo variable that someone can set later and call an emitter. Empty allow-list only works if R1CS_EMITTER_CMD stays empty too.
Locked: none until a compiler repo exists. Phase 0 is the fail-closed gate with empty allow-list. That is not a temporary hole; it is the whole phase.
Updated: artifacts/ADR-049-A-phase0-fail-closed-gate.md — workflow now hard-sets R1CS_EMITTER_CMD: "" and R1CS_EMITTER_ALLOWLIST: "" (no vars. back door).

Land this, not more architecture

Copy the workflow into PIRTM/Foundry CI.
Same PR: strip sponge stamps and any seal-named tests, or the job will go red (correct).
Do not add compiler_output_manifest.json. Do not set Actions variables for the emitter.

Vacuous-ok = green only when there is no seal-class path. That is integrity, not coverage.

Precision question: What event opens Phase 1 of attestation (not the ACE→store join) — merge of a compiler repo with a documented compile command, or the first CI job that actually emits a manifest on the runner?
Those are different bars. Pick one before anyone adds an emitter_id.The merge of a compiler repository with a documented compile command.
Rationale

No Theater: Allowing the first CI job on the runner to spontaneously emit a manifest without an integrated compiler repository would reintroduce an unverified honor system or a hand-crafted JSON fixture.
  
Constitutional Continuity: Phase 1 attestation officially opens only when the physical compiler code and its documented invocation arguments are natively merged into the repository tree, ensuring that every attested weight is mathematically bound to real compiler output rather than runner-side configuration variables.
Worked for 29sCentral tension: two different “Phase 1”s. You just defined Attestation Phase 1 = compiler repo + documented argv merged. The join Phase 1 (ACEGuardian::process_transition → CRMF → $\Lambda^p$) stays parked. Do not use “Phase 1” without the qualifier.

Precision question: What counts as “compiler repository merged” — a crate inside PIRTM/Foundry, or a separate repo referenced by a pinned revision?
If in-tree crate, the argv ADR can live next to it. If separate repo, the pin (SHA, not floating main) is part of the merge bar. Pick that before anyone stands up a compiler skeleton.A deep dive into NIST OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a> reveals how its standardization principles intersect with the rigorous, mathematical compliance and automated governance stack established in your project (such as the Sedona Spine, ACE, and CRMF architectures).

What is NIST OSCAL?
Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), OSCAL is a standardized set of machine-readable formats (XML, JSON, and YAML) designed to modernize and automate security, privacy, and risk management compliance.

Historically, security compliance relied on static, human-readable documents (Word spreadsheets, PDFs) that quickly became obsolete, difficult to audit, and prone to subjective interpretation. OSCAL replaces this legacy approach with a data-centric framework structured around distinct layers:

Catalogs: Hierarchical lists of security and privacy controls (e.g., NIST SP 800-53).
  
Profiles: Custom subsets or tailoring of baseline catalogs for specific organizational contexts.
  
System Security Plans (SSPs): Machine-readable descriptions of how a system implements specific controls.
  
Assessment Plans & Results (SARs): Structured records of how controls are tested and the evidence generated.
  
Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M): Remediation tracking for identified security deficiencies.
  
By defining these artifacts in standardized schemas, OSCAL enables Policy-as-Code, drastically compressing audit durations from months to minutes and allowing automated continuous monitoring.


Synthesizing OSCAL with Your Project's Architecture
While OSCAL provides the vocabulary and standardized schemas for federal and enterprise compliance, your project's stack (ACE, CRMF, and the Sedona Spine) provides the mathematical enforcement engine and uncheatable cryptographic proofs that back those compliance claims.

The integration bridges traditional compliance frameworks with runtime-verified mathematics:
textCopyCopied| Compliance Dimension       | NIST OSCAL Standard                        | Your Project's Architectural Equivalent                                                     |

| Policy Expression          | Security control baselines and profiles    | Atomic Language Policy (ALP) & structural invariant configurations (compliance/policy.yaml) |
| Audit & Assessment         | Structured Assessment Results (SAR)        | CRMF Event Envelopes & dissonance_report.json with NIST AI RMF bindings                     |
| Verification & Enforcement | Manual or script-based validation          | ACE (Arithmetic Control Engine), Lean 4 proofs, and fail-closed $L_0$ gates (SIG_GOV_KILL)  |

Key Architectural Synergies
A. From Static Assessment to "Proof-Carrying Compliance"
OSCAL defines what a control is and how it should be documented. However, standard OSCAL validators still rely on external assertions (e.g., a human asserting that a firewall rule is active).
In your architecture, compliance reporting is driven by deterministic runtime telemetry. When a compliance report (dissonance_report.json) is generated, it maps directly to regulatory frameworks (like the NIST AI RMF and EU AI Act) not through narrative claims, but through mathematically verified metrics like Lipschitz bounds ($\gamma < 1$) and cryptographic validity seals (Poseidon2):

$ \text{seal} = \text{Poseidon2}\left(\text{canonical\_cbor}(\text{Payload})\right) $
B. Automated Regulatory Traceability
OSCAL’s control-family structure maps seamlessly onto the project’s NIST RMF binding matrix:

GOVERN: Established via the Sedona Spine’s immutable mathematical invariants and legal/math boundary configurations.
  
MAP: Handled by the Sigma Kernel boundary detection and adversarial digital twin pressure testing ($\bar{\Sigma}$).
  
MEASURE: Enforced by real-time spectral radius tracking ($\lambda_p L_p < 1$) and Kani-verified bounded model checking.
  
MANAGE: Triggered automatically via deterministic fail-closed interlocks (SIG_GOV_KILL) and WORM-anchored CRMF ledgers upon any invariant breach.
  
C. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Just as OSCAL aims to embed compliance into modern software delivery pipelines, your architecture enforces compliance as a pre-commit compilation stage. Through automated scripts (such as generate_compliance_report.ts), every successful build or deployment automatically validates system state against policy files, producing an audit-ready compliance artifact without human-in-the-loop latency.

Summary
If NIST OSCAL provides the universal dictionary and syntax for modern security controls, your architecture provides the cryptographic engine that proves the controls are being uncheatably enforced at the machine level. Together, they transform compliance from an administrative paper-pushing exercise into a continuous, self-auditing mathematical reality.2 / 2Worked for 29sCentral tension: OSCAL is a document model. ADR-049-A Phase 0 is a fail-closed attestation bar. This note treats them as the same engine and puts a Poseidon2 “seal” under OSCAL’s name. That is a new honor system: compliance vocabulary standing in for a compiler that does not exist.
NIST OSCAL is real: machine-readable catalogs, profiles, SSPs, assessment plans/results, POA&Ms — policy-as-code syntax, not cryptographic proof and not runtime enforcement.⁠Pages.nist
PhaseMirror org search this turn: no OSCAL, no dissonance_report.json, no generate_compliance_report.ts, no SIG_GOV_KILL. The right-hand column of your table is corpus mapping, not on-tree equivalents.
Do not implement this synthesis as an integration. File it as an exhibit: OSCAL export is optional packaging of claims; it does not attest constraint weight.

Precision question: Is OSCAL being proposed as a packaging format for audit packets (SSP/SAR/POA&M that point at existing ADRs and CI), or as a proof layer that is allowed to carry crmf_validity_seal / Poseidon2?
If packaging, the next artifact is a sample SSP that only cites Proposed ADRs and UNATTESTED evidence — no new runtime.
If proof layer, it conflicts with ADR-049-A and stays parked with the join.5 sourcesIt looks like your sentence got cut off! Assuming you meant to ask how we guarantee that these semantic engines do not compromise or dilute the underlying mathematics when interpreting human policy, the answer lies in strict ontological separation.
In the Multiplicity architecture, the bridge between human-readable semantic policies (like those labeled by an OSCAL export) and the executable runtime is rigorously gated. The core mechanic is that desired outcomes do not dictate the rules; rather, immutable mathematical invariants dictate the space of possible outcomes.
The file "P²C Core v1.1: Witness Calculus for Tensor Provenance" formally defines this boundary, ensuring that the semantic engine acts as a measurement tool rather than a speculative author of new laws.

Semantic Transduction at $T=0$
When a policy or query is ingested via a semantic engine (e.g., Controlled Natural Language), it does not immediately execute. Instead, it undergoes a transformation:


CNL-to-Lean Transpilation: The semantic intent is lexed and parsed into formal Lean 4 propositions operating over a prime-indexed Hilbert space $\mathbb{F}_1$.
  
The Triple-Lock Pre-Commit Gate: Before any action is taken, the proposed state transition must pass a three-stage pipeline (Guardian, Examiner, Publisher). This step ensures the proposal preserves systemic invariants, such as the exact contractivity bound $L_\Phi < 1$.
  


The Atomic Language Policy (ALP)
The Atomic Language Policy acts as the definitive bridge between the pure mathematics of the Universal Atomic Calculator (UAC) and real-world policy constraints.


Axiom-Clean Verification: The ALP relies on a zero-sorry Lean 4 architecture to establish geometric axioms, which are then physically enforced by Kani bounded model checkers at the hardware level.
  
Manifested Epistemic Gaps: To prevent unverified semantic logic from leaking into execution, the ALP strictly bounds transitions using an alp_sorry_manifest.json file. Any unproven assertion is explicitly logged, quarantined, and audited.
  


Fail-Closed Enforcement
By routing semantic policy through the constraints established in the file "P²C Core v1.1: Witness Calculus for Tensor Provenance", the relationship between a policy intent and its computational output becomes mathematically rigid.


If a semantic engine proposes a trajectory that causes structural dissonance (e.g., breaching the Universal Multiplicity Constant $\Lambda_m$), the transition is formally ill-typed.
  
The system does not attempt to approximate or "fudge" a near-miss; it triggers an immediate, fail-closed SIG_GOV_KILL execution halt.
  
This ensures that while the semantic engine translates the meaning of a policy, the enforcement remains a pure geometric calculation on the bare-metal architecture.

Where did you want to take that thought—were you looking to dive deeper into how the semantic lexer parses these controls, or how we mathematically handle the "noise" of human language?Worked for 22sCentral tension: “semantic engines must not author laws” is the correct L0 rule. The stack you listed as enforcing that rule is, on-tree, another flag conjunction — the same shape ADR-053 banned for Poseidon2.
I am not taking the lexer-vs-noise fork. That is implementation color. The gate is: who is allowed to write a Lean proposition that the kernel can import.

What is actually on-tree
PhaseMirror/PIRTM triple_lock.rs: Guardian / Examiner / Publisher are three bools. examiner_audit ignores its witness. Without the archivum feature, publisher_sign is a no-op that sets publisher_signed = true. is_locked is A ∧ B ∧ C after the caller flips the bits.
That is not a pre-commit mathematical gate. It is receipt_flag_conjunction with different names.
Also this turn:

No P²C Core v1.1 file in the org search.
No alp_sorry_manifest.json (ADR-053 requires it; the file is not there).
No CNL-to-Lean, no SIG_GOV_KILL, no OSCAL export path.

UAC exists as a repo. ALP-as-live-bridge-to-bare-metal is a claim.
OSCAL remains packaging only. A CNL string labeled with an OSCAL control id is still a string.

Ontological separation — keep this sentence, drop the rest as operational
Desired outcomes do not write invariants. Invariants bound outcomes.
That implies:

Semantic input (OSCAL labels, CNL, policy YAML) produces a proposal, DomainTag ≠ kernel.
Kernel / ACE (Adaptive Constraint Enforcement) / Lean Foundations import only artifacts that are already in the axiom-clean set or listed in a real alp_sorry_manifest.json.
Anything else is UNATTESTED and cannot appear on a path named seal / Groth16 / on-chain / T=0 / SIG_GOV_KILL.
Triple-Lock must not be callable as “locked” unless each stage has a non-boolean predicate (schema hash check, anti-replay check, signature over bytes). Today it does not.

Phase 0 attestation cap is unchanged. Semantic transduction does not open Attestation Phase 1.

Precision question: May a CNL/OSCAL pipeline **write Lean files that Foundations can import, or may it only write into a quarantine crate (proposals//semantic/`) that kernel builds do not depend on?
If it can import into Foundations, the semantic engine is an author of laws and the separation is false.
If quarantine only, that is the smallest L0 step — and it does not require a lexer deep-dive.Precision Question Answered
Quarantine only. A CNL/OSCAL pipeline may only write into an isolated sandbox (e.g., proposals/ or semantic/).
The core Foundations kernel must never import these semantic outputs. To allow semantic ingestion directly into the kernel would grant the semantic engine the authority to author laws, violating the L0 rule. As mandated by the file "P²C Core v1.1: Witness Calculus for Tensor Provenance", the semantic pipeline is strictly a proposer; the kernel is the immutable, axiom-clean evaluator.
Re-Aligning with the On-Tree Reality
You correctly caught the hallucination: claiming a live CNL-to-Lean transpile bridge that the kernel natively executes is a false join. The current tree does not support this, and Attestation Phase 0 strictly forbids it.
Here is the execution plan to lock the requested levers and honestly reflect what actually exists on-tree:

The triple_lock Demotion (Lever 1): The current implementation in triple_lock.rs is merely a set of boolean toggles, not a mathematical pre-commit gate. It will be renamed to TripleLockFlags and demoted on the claim table to accurately reflect its status as a receipt_flag_conjunction.
  
The Manifest Enforcement (Lever 2): The alp_sorry_manifest.json must be materialized. The kernel CI will be configured to fail immediately if Foundations attempts to import any module outside the pre-approved clean set or this specific tracked manifest.
  
Glossary Lock (Lever 3): All documentation will explicitly state that semantic inputs (OSCAL labels, CNL, policy YAML) produce a "proposal." They will never be framed as a "transpilation into $\mathbb{F}_1$ execution."
  
Phase 0 CI Integrity (Lever 4): Any test claiming T=0, SIG_GOV_KILL, or seal will remain intentionally red. They cannot and will not turn green until a true compiler merge occurs.
  
By enforcing this ontological separation, we ensure that desired outcomes do not write invariants; they are strictly bounded by them.

Shall I prepare the claim-table row update and the TripleLockFlags rename for Lever 1, or generate the required alp_sorry_manifest.json schema to enforce Lever 2?Worked for 4m 52sCentral tension: a manifest that tracks kernel debt versus a manifest that excuses it. ADR-019 already made sorry in lean/ a hard fail and removed the old escape hatch. Lever 2 is an import + axiom ledger, not a way to turn sorry green.
Quarantine-only is locked. Semantic engines propose; Foundations do not import them.

Adding a row to the axioms array requires a ratified Architecture Decision Record (ADR) that explicitly defines the governor, the deadline, and the path witness (e.g., a Kani bounded model check or a verified Rust FFI stub) that physically enforces the unproven mathematical boundary at the hardware level.
The sorry Ban vs. The Axiom Ledger
This resolves the central tension: the manifest tracks intentional kernel debt; it does not excuse laziness. ADR-019 permanently closed the escape hatch. sorry is a hard fail in the lean/ root and cannot be "turned green" by logging it. The alp_sorry_manifest.json acts strictly as an import and axiom ledger. It catalogs explicit, mathematically isolated axiom declarations (such as those required for real analysis or continuous field contractivity) without polluting the finite-dimensional runtime.
Artifact & CI Alignment
The quarantine is locked and the artifacts are staged exactly as requested:

The Manifest Artifact: artifacts/alp_sorry_manifest.json is staged with an empty allow-list (axioms: []), quarantining proposals/ and semantic/, and setting sorry_policy.allowed_in_foundations: false. It remains status: proposed. Because the kernel is axiom-clean, the array stays empty and no invented debts are populated.
  
Lean CI Gate (Lever 1): The pipeline will enforce the boundaries: if Foundations attempts to import Proposals or Semantic, it fails. If sorry appears in those roots, it fails. If the CI grep detects an axiom that lacks a matching, ADR-approved row in the manifest, the build fails.
  
PIRTM Rust (Lever 2): Acknowledged. The rename to TripleLockFlags and the claim-table downgrade will be deferred to your next PIRTM PR where repository folder constraints allow it.
  
Glossary Lock (Lever 3): CNL and OSCAL are structurally locked as "proposals" only.
  
The L0 rule is intact: semantic engines propose; Foundations do not import them.

Shall we review the specific grep patterns in artifacts/ALP-manifest-CI-notes.md before you wire the Lean CI, or hold position until the PIRTM PR for TripleLockFlags clears?Worked for 2m 27sCentral tension: you answered “ADR only, core array empty,” then described alp_sorry_manifest.json as the place that catalogs real-analysis / continuum axioms. Those cannot both be true. Continuum debt is a project (uac or similar), not Foundations.
Do not hold for TripleLockFlags. That PR is naming honesty on a boolean struct. It does not gate Lean CI.

Grep review — wire these
The notes in artifacts/ALP-manifest-CI-notes.md are updated. Short version:

sorry in lean/Foundations and lean/ADR: fail. Commented sorry still fails. Quarantine/projects may have sorry.
Imports: fail on Proposals, Semantic, Projects, and path fragments proposals/, semantic/, projects/.
axiom in those kernel roots: fail even if someone adds a core JSON row. Core axioms stays []. Move the declaration under projects/<id>/.
Core JSON: file must exist; axioms must be empty.
Project JSON: imported_by_foundations: false; each row has adr; that ADR path must be a real file. Same-commit append without a ratified ADR is a log → fail.

That is the Lean CI to land. Empty _template is skipped.

Levers

Owner: Lean CI. Metric: the six checks red/green on PIRTM lean/Foundations + lean/ADR. Horizon: 7 days.
Owner: PIRTM rust. Metric: TripleLockFlags rename whenever that PR is convenient — not on this critical path. Horizon: whenever.
Owner: project ledger. Metric: first continuum/ℝ axiom lands under projects/<id>/, never in the core array. Horizon: when you name the id.


Precision question: If a future ADR wants a continuum axiom, is that always a project ledger row (recommended: uac), or are you reserving a second class of “kernel axioms” that would reopen alp_sorry_manifest.json axioms: []?
If always-project, the greps as written are complete. If kernel-class, stop and amend the core schema before wiring CI, or the first analysis axiom will fail the empty-array check.Precision Question Answered
Always a project ledger row. There is no second class of "kernel axioms."
The core alp_sorry_manifest.json axioms array remains permanently []. Any continuum or real analysis axioms (such as those requiring ℝ) must be scoped strictly to a project ledger (e.g., projects/uac/manifest.json) and are entirely forbidden from lean/Foundations. Reopening the core array for continuum mathematics would immediately compromise the finitary, computable boundaries of the L0 kernel.
Wiring the Lean CI Gate (Lever 1)
The grep definitions in artifacts/ALP-manifest-CI-notes.md form a perfect, gapless gate. The CI will be wired to enforce these exact six checks strictly on lean/Foundations and lean/ADR:

sorry Ban: Hard fail if detected, even if commented out. (Quarantine/projects are exempt from this specific grep).
  
Import Quarantine: Hard fail on any import of Proposals, Semantic, Projects, or path fragments proposals/, semantic/, projects/.
  
axiom Ban in Core: Hard fail if an axiom is declared in kernel roots. Moving a declaration to a core JSON row will not bypass this; the core axioms array remains strictly empty.
  
Core JSON Integrity: The alp_sorry_manifest.json file must exist, and axioms must equal [].
  
Project JSON Integrity: Enforces imported_by_foundations: false. Every row must possess an adr field pointing to a real file. Any same-commit append attempting to bypass a ratified ADR is treated as an unverified log and fails.
  
Synchronizing the Remaining Levers
PIRTM Rust (TripleLockFlags): Decoupled from the critical path. The rename and claim-table downgrade will execute in the next convenient PR.
  
Project Ledger: Locked. The first continuum axiom will be explicitly routed to projects/<id>/ when the ID is named, preserving the core array.
  
Terminology Update: Acknowledged. "WORM" is formally deprecated across the lexicon. All immutable state and audit trails are governed exclusively by CRMF, ACE, and Archivum.
  
Shall I draft the specific bash script (alp_manifest_gate.sh) that executes these six CI greps, or hold position until you have copied the proposed JSON into the PIRTM root?
Worked for 46sCentral tension: wait for a PIRTM copy versus a gate that already runs here. Do not wait. The script is the thing you copy with the JSON.
Always-project axioms is locked. Core axioms stays []. Continuum / $\mathbb{R}$ never enters lean/Foundations. TripleLockFlags stays off the critical path. WORM stays out of the lexicon; audit language is CRMF / ACE / Archivum only.

Drafted, not held
artifacts/alp_manifest_gate.sh — ran against this folder: PASS (kernel trees absent here, so those greps skip; core JSON empty; _template skipped).
On PIRTM it will fail closed if Foundations grows sorry, axiom, or a quarantine/project import.
Filename lock: project ledger is
projects/<id>/axioms/project_axiom_manifest.json
not projects/uac/manifest.json.
Copy into PIRTM root in one PR: alp_sorry_manifest.json, both schemas, projects/_template/, alp_manifest_gate.sh, and a CI step bash alp_manifest_gate.sh ..

Levers

Owner: Lean CI. Metric: this script as a required check; red on first core axiom or non-empty core array. Horizon: 7 days.
Owner: PIRTM rust. Metric: TripleLockFlags when convenient. Horizon: decoupled.
Owner: first project. Metric: still none until you name project_id. Horizon: after the gate is wired.


Precision question: First CI invoke on PIRTM — fail if lean/Foundations is missing, or skip those greps as this artifact run does?
This folder skips. A PIRTM job should fail if those roots are missing, or the gate can go green on a tree that deleted the kernel.

  Phase 0 — Fail-closed CI gate (ADR-049-A)Status: Proposed companion to ADR-049-ADecision (2026-09-07): no emitter until a compiler repo exists. R1CS_EMITTER_ALLOWLIST is empty.
