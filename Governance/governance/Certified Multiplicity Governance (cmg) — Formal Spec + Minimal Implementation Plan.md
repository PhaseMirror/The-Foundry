Certified Multiplicity Governance (CMG)
A formal specification for a reciprocity-centered civic system with a single stability spine (certified contraction),
auditable observables, rights-first governance gates, and uncertainty-aware tensor auditing.




0. Scope and goals
CMG is a layered system:


     1. Observation layer: logs interactions as typed events, aggregates them into intensities, reciprocity,
        and participation.
     2. Inference layer: estimates a latent relational state and a forward-looking rights-risk probability qt
        using a robust state-space model (with a dedicated jump channel).
     3. Stability layer: chooses a scalar gain Λm (t) by certified contraction (global and local certificates),
        optionally anchored to slow drift.
     4. Governance layer: admits proposals only when rights constraints hold, resonance persists above
        a calibrated threshold, and predicted rights-risk remains below a ceiling.
     5. Auditing layer: maintains a low-rank, uncertainty-aware impact tensor and produces explanations
        only at rights boundaries or regime changes.

Primary objective: make governance computable without making it unfalsifiable—all steering must be
subordinate to identifiable inference and certified stability.




1. Definitions

1.1 Sets and indices

      • Agents: V = {1, … , n}
      • Time windows: discrete index t ∈ Z with window length Δ
      • Interaction types: k ∈ K (e.g., care, labor, knowledge, repair)
      • Proposals: p ∈ P
      • Stakeholder groups: g ∈ G
      • Moral dimensions: d ∈ D (e.g., dignity, autonomy, fairness, privacy, safety)

1.2 Event log

An event is


                                           e = (i → j, τ , k, a, ctx)

where: - i, j ∈ V : source/target - τ : timestamp - k ∈ K: type - a ≥ 0: magnitude - ctx: optional context
metadata (channel, task id, etc.)




                                                         1
1.3 Aggregated interaction intensities

For a time window [t − Δ, t]:


                                           xkij (t) =            ∑              ae
                                                        e: i→j, k, τ ∈[t−Δ,t]

Typed weights αk > 0 yield total intensity


                                             xij (t) = ∑ αk xkij (t).
                                                           k∈K


1.4 Reciprocity, participation, and multiplicity

Pairwise reciprocal coupling:


                                       rij (t) = min{xij (t), xji (t)}.

Total reciprocity:


                                              C(t) =        ∑ rij (t).
                                                          1≤i<j≤n

Total participation:


                                                P (t) = ∑ xij (t).
                                                             i =j

Multiplicity observable (dimensionless):

                                                   C(t)
                                  M(t) =                     ,            β ∈ [0, 1].
                                               Λm (t) P (t)β

Interpretation: - C(t) measures matched reciprocity. - P (t) controls for raw activity/logging volume. -
Λm (t) is a certified gain ensuring the latent dynamics remain contractive.

1.5 Latent state and observations

Latent relational state:


      • St ∈ Rd summarizes relational dynamics (trust/strain/cohesion proxies).

Observation vector:


      • Ot aggregates measurable signals (incidents, moderation actions, surveys, churn, message rates,
       etc.).




                                                             2
2. Inference model (Ξ as identified state + measurement)

2.1 State equation (discrete-time)

                                        St+1 = F (St , Ut ) + Jt + ωt

where: - Ut : optional exogenous inputs (platform changes, policy updates, holidays) - ωt : routine process
noise - Jt : jump channel reserved for rights-critical shocks (sparse, heavy magnitude)


2.2 Observation equation

                                              Ot = G(St ) + ϵt

with robust noise


                                                  ϵt ∼ tν (0, R).

2.3 Rights-risk probability

Define a rights-risk event label Et:t+Δ ∈ {0, 1} (conservative operationalization, see §6). The filter produces


                                        qt := Pr(Et:t+Δ = 1 ∣ O≤t ).

2.4 Identifiability / observability guard

CMG forbids treating St as meaningful unless the observation map has sufficient information:


     • Compute an empirical observability / Fisher-information proxy over a rolling window.
     • If the proxy rank falls below a threshold, reduce state dimension or enrich observations.

This is a required precondition for any governance steering.




3. Single stability spine: certified contraction and Λm (t)

3.1 Local linearization / Jacobian proxy

                                           ^t :
Define a local linear approximation around S


                                              St+1 ≈ At St + bt .

At may be derived from: - Jacobian of a learned F - local regression / linearization fit - or a stable
parametrization (e.g., diagonal + low-rank)


3.2 Contraction margin

Choose a contraction margin ϵ ∈ (0, 1). The goal is to enforce a certified contraction factor 1 − ϵ.




                                                        3
3.3 Two certificates

Global certificate (operator norm):

                                                                   1−ϵ
                                                  Λglob (t) =             .
                                                                   ∥At ∥2

Local certificate (metric contraction):


Choose a PSD metric Qt ≻ 0 (e.g., from filter covariance or a Lyapunov candidate). Define

                                                                   1−ϵ
                                     Λloc (t) =                                          .
                                                                  1/2         −1/2
                                                    λmax (Qt A⊤
                                                              t Qt At Qt             )

Equivalent inequality form:


                                              A⊤                2
                                               t Qt At ⪯ (1 − ϵ) Qt .


3.4 Hybrid certified gain policy

                                     Λm (t) = min{Λglob (t), Λloc (t), Λmax }.

Interpretation: the safer bound always wins.


3.5 Optional slow-drift prior (anchored, never destabilizing)
                          ~
Propose a drifting gain Λm (t) via AR(1) on the log scale:

                                     ~                  ~
                                 log Λm (t) = μ + ϕ(log Λm (t − 1) − μ) + νt .

Then certify by clipping:

                                             ~
                                Λm (t) = min{Λm (t), Λglob (t), Λloc (t), Λmax }.



4. Governance layer: resonance + rights-first gates

4.1 Resonance score

For proposal p, define


                                               Rp (t) = Ap (t) ⋅ Ip (t),

where: - Ap (t) ∈ [0, 1]: alignment (stance variance, agreement, or structured consent) - Ip (t) ∈ [0, 1]:
insight/quality (feasibility, reversibility, equity checks)




                                                              4
4.2 Persistence window

Let ω denote a stability window. Persistence requirement:


                                               min Rp (u) ≥ θt .
                                             u∈[t−ω,t]


4.3 Rights predicate (hard constraint)

A proposal must satisfy


                                              Rights(p) = true.

Rights is an explicit checklist / predicate over constraints (privacy bounds, non-coercion, due process,
minimum guarantees, etc.). It is not optimized as a soft penalty.


4.4 Risk ceiling

Only admit proposals when predicted rights-risk is sufficiently low:


                                                   qt ≤ qmax .

4.5 Admission rule

A proposal p passes at time t iff:


     1. Rights(p) = true, and
     2. minu∈[t−ω,t] Rp (u) ≥ θt , and
     3. qt ≤ qmax .

4.6 Calibration-driven θt updates

Update θt to maintain a target false-negative bound on rights-risk (calibration target), rather than relying
only on "stable/unstable" history.


Operationally: - Maintain a passing-decision set Dt . - Require empirical Pr(E = 1 ∣ pass) to stay below a
configured ceiling.




5. Tensorial auditing layer

5.1 Group-level ethical impact tensor

Define impacts

                                                                   2
                                         Yg,a,d,t ∼ N (Yg,a,d,t , τg,a,d,t )

where: - g ∈ G : stakeholder group - a ∈ A: institutional action type - d ∈ D : moral dimension




                                                         5
5.2 Low-rank factorization (rank-capped)

Use CP/Tucker with a capped rank K and sparsity support. The purpose is forecasting + uncertainty—not
metaphysical truth.


5.3 Explanation budget

Generate explanations/attributions only when: - a rights boundary is approached/violated, or - a regime-
change alert fires (latent factor shift, residual spike).




6. Invariants and required properties
These are the invariants CMG must preserve.


6.1 Certified contraction invariant

At every time t, the chosen Λm (t) must satisfy the certificate inequalities (global and/or local). If neither can
be satisfied (e.g., Λm (t) falls below a minimum), CMG must: - declare the model unstable/untrustworthy, -
halt steering (freeze governance automation), and - require human review / model retraining.


6.2 Rights-first invariant

No optimization or threshold update may override Rights(⋅). If Rights fails, the proposal cannot pass.


6.3 Identifiability invariant

If observability checks fail, CMG must reduce model complexity or enrich observations before using qt for
governance.


6.4 Calibration invariant

The risk predictor qt must pass calibration thresholds (e.g., Brier score, reliability curve) prior to enabling
any automated steering (θt adaptation).


6.5 Auditability invariant

Every decision must be reproducible from: - immutable event logs (or cryptographic hashes), - model
version IDs, and - the stored Λm certificates and governance gates applied.




7. Test suite (must-run)

7.1 Unit tests (logic correctness)

     1. Event aggregation: intensities xkij match manual counts.




                                                        6
     2. Reciprocity correctness: rij = min(xij , xji ).
     3. Multiplicity computation: M(t) handles edge cases (P (t) = 0, missing types).
     4. Rights predicate: returns deterministic pass/fail with explicit reasons.

7.2 Certificate tests (stability spine)

     1. Global certificate: verify ∥Λm At ∥2 ≤ 1 − ϵ.
     2. Local certificate: verify A⊤                2
                                   t Qt At ⪯ (1 − ϵ) Qt .
     3. Hybrid policy: Λm = min(⋅) always satisfies the stricter bound.
     4. Non-normal stress: generate non-normal A where spectral radius differs from norm; confirm local
       vs global behavior is meaningful.

7.3 Inference tests (statistical correctness)

     1. Filter sanity: predictive residuals show no systematic drift under stable periods.
     2. Jump channel detection: injected shock events increase jump probability; routine noise does not.
     3. Identifiability: rank proxy flags underdetermined states.

7.4 Calibration and prediction tests

     1. Calibration: reliability curve within tolerance; Brier score below a defined baseline.
     2. Predictive lift: qt beats baselines (activity-only, sentiment-only) on AUC/log-loss.
     3. Lead time: median lead time to rights-risk events exceeds baseline by a defined margin.

7.5 Governance tests

     1. Admission rule: proposals fail if any gate fails; gates are logged with reasons.
     2. Persistence: resonance must stay above θt for full ω .
     3. No-override: rights failures cannot be "fixed" by improving resonance.

7.6 Gaming resistance tests

     1. Reciprocity spam: simulated low-magnitude ping-pong does not produce outsized M(t) (requires
        diminishing returns / anti-collusion rule if needed).
     2. Logging policy drift: changes in reporting rate are detected (participation normalization; bias latent
        if implemented).




8. Minimal implementation plan
This plan prioritizes identifiable, deployable modules first, postponing high-variance choices.


8.1 Data schema (minimal viable)

Table: events - event_id (uuid) - ts (timestamp) - actor_id (string) - target_id (string or null) - interaction_type
(enum) - magnitude (float, default 1.0) - context (json: channel/task/thread)




                                                          7
Table: windows (precomputed aggregates per window) - window_end_ts - x_ij_type_sparse (optional: stored
as edge list table) - x_ij_sparse - r_ij_sparse - C_total - P_total - n_active_agents


Table: observations (per window) - window_end_ts - incident_count (int) - mod_actions (int) - churn_count
(int) - complaint_count (int) - survey_trust_mean (float, optional) - other platform signals


Table: proposals - proposal_id - created_ts - active_until_ts - alignment_series (time-indexed) - insight_series
(time-indexed) - rights_checklist_result (json + boolean) - decision_ts - outcome (passed/failed)


Table: model_registry - model_version - parameters (json) - training_window - feature_schema_hash


Table: certificates - window_end_ts - model_version - A_t (reference/summary) - Q_t (reference/summary) -
Lambda_glob - Lambda_loc - Lambda_m - epsilon - pass/fail flags


Table: risk_predictions - window_end_ts - model_version - q_t - calibration_bin (optional)


8.2 Easiest model choices to fit first

Stage 1: Baseline risk model (fast, interpretable) - Logistic regression / Poisson regression predicting
rights-risk events using: - incident_count, mod_actions, churn_count, complaint_count - C_total, P_total,
C/P β (no Λm yet) - Purpose: establish baselines, labels, and evaluation pipelines.

Stage 2: Linear Gaussian state-space (Kalman) with robustification - Start with linear dynamics: -
St+1 = ASt + But + ωt - Ot = HSt + ϵt - Use robust innovations (Huber) before moving to Student-t. -
Estimate A, H via EM. - Derive At ≡ A initially (time-invariant) for certificates.


Stage 3: Jump channel (rights-critical shocks) - Add a two-regime mixture: - normal regime + shock
regime - Simple implementation: latent indicator zt ∈ {0, 1} with elevated process noise when zt = 1.


Stage 4: Certified Λm (t) gating - Implement global certificate first (cheap): ∥A∥2 . - Then add local
certificate with Q from covariance or a fixed Lyapunov metric. - Turn on hybrid min policy.


Stage 5: Governance gating (shadow mode) - Compute Rp (t), θt fixed. - Use rights predicate as strict
gate. - Run in shadow mode; log hypothetical pass/fail.


Stage 6: Calibration-driven θt - Enable threshold adaptation only after calibration checks pass for N
consecutive windows. - Maintain a false-negative target for rights-risk.


Stage 7: Tensor auditing (optional, later) - Implement group-level low-rank factorization only after stable
inference + governance gating are validated. - Start with CP rank K ≤ 5 and sparse data handling.


8.3 Minimal label definitions (for validation)

Rights-risk event (conservative): define Et:t+Δ = 1 if any of: - spike in targeted harassment reports -
emergency moderator interventions - verified privacy breach - formal grievance escalation




                                                       8
Keep it conservative to avoid muddy ground truth.


8.4 Evaluation metrics (required)

     • Calibration: Brier score, reliability curve
     • Discrimination: AUC, log-loss
     • Lead time: time-to-event detection
     • Governance safety: empirical Pr(E = 1 ∣ pass)
     • Stability: frequency of Λm clipping; certificate failure rate




9. Release discipline
CMG must ship with: - an immutable log schema, - a model registry with versioning, - certificate outputs
stored per window, - and a reproducible evaluation notebook/runner that regenerates all metrics.


Steering is only enabled after: 1) identifiability checks pass, 2) calibration meets thresholds, and 3)
certificate failures are rare and explainable.
