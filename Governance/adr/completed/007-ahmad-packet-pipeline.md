# ADR 007: Ahmad Packet Generation & Zeroproof Docking Pipeline

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
Ahmad Ali Parr's **Sovereign Digital Twin** requires a secure, deterministic mechanism to dock with the Lawful Protocol-State. The twin generates proposals via AVP (Actual Value Proposition) and VP (Value Proposition) predicates. To close the "analytic gap" and prevent reliance on human levers, these predicates must be transformed into actionable payloads—**Ahmad Packets**—that can be systematically validated and executed by the Goldilocks Kernel.

The validation relies heavily on the Lean 4 formalized **Jubilee Coordination Window** ($\Delta J$) and the ERE 5-Pass pipeline to ensure zero cross-domain leakage and strict bounds on immunological memory growth.

## Architecture & Decisions

### 1. The Ahmad Packet Schema
An Ahmad Packet is the serialized transport layer (e.g., Protobuf) containing:
1.  **State Delta**: The raw SUBLEQ operation memory offsets ($A$, $B$).
2.  **AVP/VP Predicates**: The domain-specific legal/economic logical assertions.
3.  **Drift Certificate**: 
    *   `tissue_id`: Target sovereign tissue.
    *   `tick`: The synchronized global clock tick at generation.
    *   `claimed_thickness`: The expected `surviving_structure` metric at `tick`.
4.  **Twin Signature**: Cryptographic proof of origin.

### 2. Zeroproof Docking Pipeline (The Kernel Gate)
Upon receiving an Ahmad Packet, the Goldilocks Kernel executes the following pipeline:

1.  **Jubilee Admission Filter**:
    *   The kernel evaluates `jubilee_admissible(packet.DriftCertificate, current_tick, ΔJ, AuditLog)`.
    *   **Rule**: The packet's `tick` must fall within the current active $\Delta J$, and the `claimed_thickness` must exactly match the `TissueSnapshot` anchored in the Lambda-Proof / Archivum log.
    *   *Failure*: Immediate rejection ($\perp_R(E)$). No human override permitted.
2.  **Morphism Translation & RegHom Check**:
    *   The AVP/VP predicates are translated to a prime factorization transition ($p_{src} \to p_{tgt}$).
    *   The transition is verified against the `RegHom` registry (Clonal Selection).
3.  **ERE 5-Pass Evaluation**:
    *   The packet passes through the 5 ERE validators (Factorization, Policy, Non-Expansion, Anchor Integrity, Lambda-Proof / Archivum Survival).
4.  **Token-1 Emission & Execution**:
    *   If admitted, the kernel produces the `Token-1` truth vector.
    *   The SUBLEQ delta is applied to memory.
    *   A new Lambda-Proof / Archivum block is committed exactly at the Jubilee window boundary.

## Engineering Pipeline

*   **Phase 1: Packet Serialization Schema**
    *   Define the Protobuf/Serde schemas for the `AhmadPacket` and `DriftCertificate` in the Rust `lambda_proof_archivum_rs` ensemble.
*   **Phase 2: The Adapter Implementation**
    *   Develop the translation layer mapping AVP/VP predicates to canonical MOC prime transitions ($p_{src}$, $p_{tgt}$).
    *   **Verification Constraint**: This phase must produce a formal Lean 4 lemma (`avp_to_prime_sound`) proving that the translation preserves the logical content of the predicate and strictly respects non-expansion bounds.
*   **Phase 3: Jubilee Filter Integration**
    *   Implement the `jubilee_admissible` runtime check in the `goldilocks_kernel` C/Rust codebase, matching the Lean 4 formalization.
*   **Phase 4: Adversarial Harness Extension**
    *   Update the 10,000-case simulator to emit spoofed/stale Ahmad Packets to empirically test Jubilee window contraction and tissue sync failures.
