Yes. This gives Prism a much more precise role than “a framework with BDD features.”

BDD/Cucumber describes **observable behavior fragments** well, but it does not intrinsically define the cohesive system in which those behaviors live. DDD supplies that missing boundary and vocabulary. Prism should formalize both layers in one semantic model, and LexLean should compile that model all the way from definition to verified deployment.

The architecture I would use is:

```

From that certified module, the system **fans out**. It should not be modeled as LaTeX coming after binary generation or HTML coming after LaTeX.

```

That distinction matters technically. CompCert currently targets native architectures such as x86, ARM/AArch64, PowerPC and RISC-V; it is not itself a direct “WASM/UEFI/OCI compiler.” ([CompCert][1]) WebAssembly is an execution target with its own core semantics and embedding interfaces. ([WebAssembly][2]) OCI, by contrast, specifies image/layout/runtime packaging rather than an instruction target. ([https://opencontainers.github.io][3])

So Prism should call that layer something like **verified executable lowering**, of which CompCert can be one implementation.

## Prism's fundamental unit should be the Component

I think this is the missing abstraction connecting DDD, BDD, compilation and deployment.

A `PrismComponent` should be the smallest independently meaningful cohesive model:

```text
PrismComponent
├── Identity
├── Domain
├── Behavior
├── Proof
├── Execution
├── Interfaces
├── Presentation
├── Deployment
└── Runtime
```

The domain and behavior portions are authored. Most of the later portions are derived or refined from them.

### Domain Header

The Domain Header answers:

> **What is this thing?**

It defines the bounded conceptual universe:

```text
domain Commerce.Ordering

imports
    Commerce.Identity
    Commerce.Payment

concept Order
value OrderId
value Money

aggregate Order
    identity OrderId
    contains LineItem

relation placedBy : Order -> Customer

invariant positivet0tal
    ...

port Payment
    ...

policy ...
```

It contains no implementation accident such as “PostgreSQL table” or “HTTP controller” unless those themselves are explicitly part of the modeled domain.

The domain gives every behavior a meaning.

### Behavior Header

The Behavior Header answers:

> **What can this thing do, and what must remain true when it does it?**

Conceptually:

```text
behavior PlaceOrder

within Commerce.Ordering

given
    customer exists
    cart is nonempty

when
    PlaceOrder(customer, cart)

then
    Order exists
    order belongs to customer
    total equals cart total

emits
    OrderPlaced

preserves
    positivet0tal
```

Now Gherkin is just one lens:

```gherkin
Feature: Place order

Scenario: Valid order
  Given a customer exists
  And the customer's cart is nonempty
  When the customer places the order
  Then an order exists
  And the order belongs to the customer
```

The Gherkin **doesn't define the behavior**.

The Prism behavior does.

That eliminates the familiar BDD problem where a repository accumulates hundreds of scenarios but nobody can reconstruct a coherent domain model from them.

## Lean then proves the joined domain/behavior model

The proof obligations arise mechanically.

If a behavior is a transition

[
\tau : S \times C \rightarrow S \times E
]

and the domain defines invariant (I : S\to Prop), Prism can derive obligations of the form

[
I(s)\land Pre(s,c)
\Rightarrow
I(\pi_1(\tau(s,c))).
]

Likewise a `Then` statement is not merely acceptance-test prose; it becomes a proposition about the transition result.

Thus one behavior can generate:

```text
Prism behavior
      │
      ├── Lean theorem
      ├── Gherkin scenario
      ├── executable handler
      ├── property test
      ├── API description
      └── documentation
```

That is the unification we were looking for.

## UOR Atlas belongs below Prism, not beside it

Your statement that the **UOR Atlas is LexLean's foundation model** becomes much more concrete under this architecture.

I would define the stack as:

```text
UOR Atlas
    │
    ▼
UOR Framework
    │
    ▼
Prism semantic model
    │
    ▼
LexLean compiler
    │
    ▼
Prism applications
    │
    ▼
Hologram
```

More precisely:

**Atlas** supplies the foundational object/reference/address/locality structure.

**UOR Framework** supplies the general ontology and operations over those objects.

**Prism** specializes those foundations into an information-system model: domain boundaries, components, state, behavior, interfaces, composition, deployment and runtime inhabitance.

**LexLean** accepts Prism definitions, proves them, compiles executable projections and renders their lenses.

**Hologram** is the reference Prism application/system proving that the entire stack can inhabit a real runtime.

The current public UOR Framework already describes itself as a typed ontology and exports multiple views—Rust traits, JSON-LD, Turtle, N-Triples, OWL, JSON Schema, SHACL and EBNF—from one ontology source. ([GitHub][4]) That is philosophically very close to the projection model we're describing.

The current `UOR-Foundation/prism` repository, however, is narrower: today it defines Prism primarily as a Rust standard-library façade over `uor-foundation` plus Layer-3 axis crates.

I wouldn't throw that work away. I would reposition it:

```text
Current prism Rust standard library
              ↓
Prism standard-domain/runtime library

New normative Prism model
              ↓
defined in LexLean
              ↓
may generate / constrain / prove
the standard library implementation
```

So Rust stops being the definition of Prism.

Prism becomes the semantic model.

## Deployment should itself be part of the domain model

This is the next major step you identified.

A component shouldn't stop being modeled once it has produced a binary.

The semantic chain should continue:

```text
Component
    ↓
Executable
    ↓
Artifact
    ↓
Deployment
    ↓
Instance
```

And each step should preserve identity/provenance.

Conceptually:

```text
ComponentDefinition
    id = C

CertifiedExecutable
    realizes = C
    target = wasm32

DeploymentDefinition
    artifact = CertifiedExecutable
    environment = Browser

RuntimeInstance
    realizes = DeploymentDefinition
    place = ...
    state = ...
```

This is where Atlas becomes particularly valuable.

The runtime object is not merely an arbitrary Kubernetes pod ID or browser tab UUID. A runtime inhabitant can have a UOR identity/address and a place/localization within the Atlas-derived space.

That gives a potentially very powerful invariant:

[
\text{Definition}
\rightarrow
\text{Proof}
\rightarrow
\text{Executable}
\rightarrow
\text{Deployment}
\rightarrow
\text{Instance}
]

without losing the reference to **what thing this runtime instance actually inhabits**.

## The four principal Prism deployment profiles

I would make these semantic profiles rather than bespoke toolchains:

```text
BareMetal
    executable
    machine/architecture
    memory model
    boot contract
    hardware resources

Browser
    WASM module
    Web API imports
    DOM/Web Component interface
    origin/storage/network capabilities

Host
    native/WASM executable
    OS capabilities
    filesystem/network/process contracts

Cloud
    executable
    OCI artifact
    runtime configuration
    resources
    services
    network/storage identities
```

OCI is especially compatible with Prism's content-addressed approach because OCI itself is descriptor/content-address oriented; image layouts store content-addressed blobs and manifests/configuration identify the runnable artifact. ([https://opencontainers.github.io][5])

Cloud is therefore not a separate application model. It is an **inhabitation/deployment lens over the same Prism component**.

Likewise:

```text
same Prism component
    ├── browser deployment
    ├── bare-metal deployment
    ├── host deployment
    └── OCI deployment
```

provided its capability requirements can be satisfied by each environment.

## This suggests the complete Prism hierarchy

I would now define Prism around seven semantic strata:

```text
P0  Foundation
    UOR Atlas / UOR Framework primitives

P1  Domain
    concepts, types, identities, relations,
    aggregates, invariants, bounded contexts

P2  Behavior
    commands, queries, events, transitions,
    features, scenarios, policies

P3  Composition
    components, ports, contracts, dependencies,
    contexts, applications, systems

P4  Certification
    propositions, proof obligations, proofs,
    refinement relationships

P5  Realization
    executable functions, memory/state representation,
    interfaces, ABI/API lowering

P6  Deployment
    target, artifact, boot/runtime envelope,
    resource/capability requirements

P7  Inhabitation
    running instance, place, address, state,
    topology, observations, lifecycle
```

And lenses can operate at any level:

```text
academic lens    P0–P4
Gherkin lens     P1–P2
API lens         P1–P3/P5
HTML docs        P0–P7
Web Components   P1–P3/P5
OCI lens         P5–P6
operations UI    P6–P7
```

That is much more general than viewing LexLean as merely a formal-document compiler.

## Hologram then has a very useful burden of proof

Hologram should not merely be “an app built using Prism.”

It should be the **reference full-stack inhabitant**.

A credible completion criterion would be that Hologram is defined once as Prism and the same definition yields:

```text
Hologram
├── formally verified domain model
├── formally verified behavior
├── Gherkin conformance corpus
├── executable WASM/native realizations
├── browser application
├── host executable
├── bare-metal image where supported
├── OCI/cloud artifact
├── Web Component UI
├── HTML documentation
├── academic/system specification
└── runtime instance graph
```

All linked to the same semantic module identity.

That would demonstrate the actual meaning of **Prism compiler**.

So I think the next major specification work for LexLean should no longer be framed as “add more output backends.” Before the backends, we need to define the **complete Prism semantic model**—especially `Domain`, `Behavior`, `Component`, `Application`, `Deployment`, and `Instance`—on top of UOR Framework/Atlas.

Once those are correct, Lean, WASM/native compilation, Gherkin, LaTeX, HTML/Web Components and OCI become projections rather than independently designed subsystems.
