# ADR-PML-100: Documented Lean theorems missing in the `general` subsystem (1 gaps)

## Status
Proposed

## Axis (Phase Mirror tension class)
urgency vs capacity

## Owner (multi-agent lever)
`the-examiner`

## Dissonance Score
- Impact = severity (4) x blast radius (1) = **4**
- Tractability = **1.0**
- **Score = 4.0**  (cluster rank 6 of 7)

## Context (stated intent vs implementation)
The documented intent below is not reflected by the current mathematical Lean 4
implementation. This is a measured gap produced by the Phase Mirror operational
loop.

### Stated intent (documents)
  - docs/adr/completed/ADR-090-Mathlib-Sorry-Elimination-Plan.md:34 — asserts `Init` exists / is verified

### Implementation reality (lean/)
  - `Init` not found among 7016 lean declarations

### Manifested boundary
Leaked (unmanifested): YES — gap is NOT manifested in `alp_sorry_manifest.json` (silent leak risk)

## Decision (the lever)
Resolve the dissonance by manifesting the gap and closing it with a verified
artifact rather than letting the claimed guarantee stand unbacked. Treat the
unproven claim as `Proposed` until a Lean proof (or a manifested `sorry` + Rust
stub, per `alp_sorry_manifest.json`) backs it.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: claimed guarantees become auditable; silent leaks into policy
  decisions are eliminated; the UAC-ALP boundary stays honest on every CI run.
- **Negative / Constraints**: temporary downgrade of the marketing-grade claim
  until the proof lands; added CI surface for the manifested stub.
- **Verification Strategy**: re-run `scripts/phase_mirror_loop.py`; the tension
  must drop out of the ranked list (score -> 0) once the backing proof exists
  and the manifest is reconciled.

## Metrics (resolution is confirmed when)
- The cited theorem/invariant exists in `lean/` and compiles free of unmanifested `sorry`.
- OR the gap is explicitly listed in `alp_sorry_manifest.json` with a paired Rust stub + governance test.
- Dissonance score for this axis trends to 0 on subsequent loop runs.

## Actionable Levers
1. Discharge the `sorry` in the existing `general` declaration; add a `lake build` regression test proving the theorem.
2. Reconcile `alp_sorry_manifest.json`: remove the entry once the proof lands so the boundary shrinks.
3. Re-run `scripts/phase_mirror_loop.py` and confirm this tension's score decreases.
