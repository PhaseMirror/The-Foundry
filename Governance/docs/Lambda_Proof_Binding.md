# Lambda-Proof Binding to Multiplicity Protocol

**Owner:** Ryan  
**Objective:** Map Lambda-Proof to a multiplicity operator sequence for transaction attestation and state transition, including PIRTM contraction and admissibility conditions.  

## 1. Context & Threat Model

The transition to a sovereign ledger requires enforcing the **PhaseMirror Civic State** (`Hundian Ground State`) as a validity condition for blockchain state transitions. By bridging the Multiplicity Protocol (prime-indexed recursion, track B certification) into a `lambda-proof` ZK circuit, we elevate the `L0-10` threshold (Civic State $\ge 1.0$) into an unforgeable, consensus-level constraint.

## 2. Multiplicity Operator Sequence

To achieve state transition via Lambda-Proof, each transaction or state update is passed through the following sequence inside the ZK circuit:

1. **Uniqueness Anchoring (`Op_U`)**: Verify the provided Identity Proof anchors against the cryptographic registry (`UniquenessAnchor`).
2. **Civic Profile Extractor (`Op_E`)**: Read the 4-Factor Minimal Core (`Resonance`, `Agency`, `Integrity`, `Viability`) bound to the subject's anchor.
3. **PIRTM Contraction (`Op_C`)**: Aggregate the active cohort's civic profiles. Let $n$ be the cohort size.
   $$ S_{civic} = \lambda_m \times \left( \frac{\sum R + \sum A + \sum I + \sum V}{n} \right) \times \text{reciprocity} \times \text{embodied_viability} $$
   *(In the finite field, this division is mapped via fixed-point inverse operations: $n^{-1} \pmod p$)*
4. **Admissibility Gate (`Op_A`)**: The circuit asserts `S_civic >= L0-10_Threshold`. If this constraint fails, the proof generation halts (completeness failure), safely discarding dissonant blocks before they reach consensus.

## 3. Admissibility Condition & Contractivity

For a proof $\Pi$ asserting a transition from state $S_i$ to $S_{i+1}$ to be admissible on-chain, the following conditions must hold as public inputs/outputs:

* **PIRTM Contractivity:** The system's drift rate must remain bounded (contractivity score $\le 100$ on scaled integers).
* **Threshold Guarantee:** The aggregated Civic State must strictly equal or exceed the scaled integer mapping of `1.0` (represented as `100` in the formal skeleton).

This maps the continuous socio-atomic model onto discrete, verifiable constraints that are strictly checked by the smart contract verifier.

## 4. Lean 4 Formal Verification Skeleton

A structural skeleton has been provided in `src/ADR/LambdaProofBinding.lean`. It formally models:
- `LedgerState` and `LambdaProofOutput`
- The `AdmissibilityCondition` function
- A proven theorem (`admissible_implies_civic_minimum`) demonstrating that any state transition successfully verified against these constraints mathematically guarantees the civic state floor (sorry-bounded proofs in manifest).

This completes the bounded deliverable for the Lambda-Proof binding spec.
