# ADR-061: ZMOS (Zeta-Multiplicity Operator System) Production Implementation

## Status
**Partially Implemented** — ZMOS axiom-based formalization exists; `ZmosSupersedes` acyclicity proven but full operator algebra verification pending. Reclassified 2026-07-23 per ADR-PML-DISRESOLVE-001.

## Context
The `Prime/lean/ZMOS/Zmos.lean` module provides a substantive Lean 4 formalization of the Zeta-Multiplicity Operator System, including operator algebra over prime-graded Hilbert spaces, spectral radius bounds, RG renormalization conditions, and a C-ABI FFI bridge to the Rust Sedona Spine Engine (`@[extern "get_dimension_rs"]`). 

Currently, the ZMOS formalization exists as a standalone Lean artifact without a ratified production ADR governing its deployment, verification pipeline, or FFI contract. The Rust engine side lacks a corresponding `zmos` crate that consumes the Lean-proved invariants. Without a formal decision record, the ZMOS operator algebra risks:
- **Drift between Lean proofs and Rust implementation**: The FFI boundary could silently diverge if contractivity bounds are reimplemented in Rust without Lean verification.
- **Unratified spectral bounds**: The `spectralBoundCondition` and `rg_convergent` proof obligations are not yet enforced in CI or runtime.
- **Missing audit trail**: The Sedona Spine Mandate requires every structural invariant to have a machine-checked provenance chain from formal proof to runtime enforcement.

## Decision
We will ratify ZMOS as a **production-grade, formally verified kernel component** of the Multiplicity Sovereign Core framework, with the following binding mandates:

### 1. Lean 4 Formal Core as Source of Truth
- `Prime/lean/ZMOS/Zmos.lean` is the **sole authoritative specification** for ZMOS operator algebra, spectral bounds, and RG convergence.
- All Rust implementations of ZMOS primitives (`Prime`, `HilbertSpace`, `Operator`, `spectralRadius`, `spectralBoundCondition`) must be extracted from or proven equivalent to the Lean definitions via FFI.
- No ZMOS logic may be reimplemented in Rust without a corresponding Lean theorem and a mechanized proof of equivalence (`lake build && lake test` on the `adr-governance` package must pass).

### 2. Rust Engine Parity via FFI Contract
- The Sedona Spine will expose a dedicated `zmos` crate (or module within `engine/`) that:
  - Implements `spectralRadius` using exact `rug`/GMP arithmetic for the Rust side.
  - Enforces `spectralBoundCondition` at runtime: any operator whose computed spectral radius exceeds the Lean-proved bound triggers a `PhaseError` and halts the affected computation.
  - Provides a `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"` entry point `zmos_verify_spectral_bound(op: *const Operator) -> bool` consumable by the WASM SDK and Lean FFI.

### 3. CI/CD Enforcement
- The CI pipeline must run `lake build` on `Prime/lean/adr-governance/` and `Prime/lean/ZMOS/` on every commit touching `Zmos.lean` or `crates/zmos/`.
- A Rust Kani proof harness (`crates/zmos/tests/kani/spectral_bound.rs`) must prove that `spectralBoundCondition` holds for all operators constructed via the public API.
- The `Archivum` witness ledger must record a `ZmosSpectralProof` artifact for every accepted operator configuration.

### 4. Deprecation and Supersession Protocol
- ZMOS may be **deprecated** only by a ratified ADR that introduces a successor operator algebra (`ZMOSv2`).
- The supersession chain must be recorded in `Prime/lean/adr-governance/` and the `Archivum` ledger, ensuring traceability from every deprecated operator to its replacement.

## Formal Proof Obligations

### 1. FFI Equivalence: Lean `spectralRadius` ≡ Rust `spectral_radius`
We must prove that the Rust implementation computes the exact same spectral radius as the Lean 4 formalization for all operators within the `InteractingZmosSystem` domain.

**Lean 4 Formalization Sketch:**
```lean
import ADR.Core
import Zmos

namespace ADR.Zmos

/-- Rust spectral radius computation via FFI -/
@[extern "zmos_spectral_radius_rs"]
opaque rustSpectralRadius (op : Operator) : ℝ

/-- Theorem: Rust FFI spectral radius matches Lean proof -/
@[proof]
theorem ffi_spectral_radius_equivalence (op : Operator) :
  rustSpectralRadius op = spectralRadius op := by
  -- This theorem is proved by:
  -- 1. Extracting the Rust implementation's algorithm as a Lean spec via FFI
  -- 2. Proving both compute the same matrix norm via spectral mapping theorem
  -- 3. Using the `spectralBoundCondition` lemma to bound numerical error
  sorry  -- mechanized in Zmos.lean FFI bridge module

end ADR.Zmos
```

### 2. Runtime Enforcement of `spectralBoundCondition`
We must prove that the Rust engine's runtime check rejects any operator violating the Lean-proved spectral bound.

**Lean 4 Formalization Sketch:**
```lean
namespace ADR.Zmos

/-- Rust runtime check for spectral bound violation -/
@[extern "zmos_verify_spectral_bound_rs"]
opaque rustVerifySpectralBound (op : Operator) : Bool

/-- Theorem: Rust runtime check is sound w.r.t. Lean spectral bound -/
@[proof]
theorem runtime_spectral_bound_sound (op : Operator) :
  rustVerifySpectralBound op = true → spectralRadius op ≤ spectralBoundCondition op := by
  -- Proof that the Rust check implements the exact same predicate as the Lean bound
  sorry  -- mechanized via Kani + FFI model

end ADR.Zmos
```

### 3. No Circular Supersession in ZMOS Operator Families
We must prove that the ZMOS operator family hierarchy (local modes → interacting system → successor) is acyclic.

**Lean 4 Formalization Sketch:**
```lean
namespace ADR.Zmos

inductive ZmosFamily
  | localMode (name : String)
  | interactingSystem (components : List ZmosFamily)
  | successor (prev : ZmosFamily)

def ZmosSupersedes : ZmosFamily → ZmosFamily → Prop
  | ZmosFamily.successor p, ZmosFamily.localMode n => p = ZmosFamily.localMode n
  | ZmosFamily.successor p, ZmosFamily.interactingSystem cs => p = ZmosFamily.interactingSystem cs
  | _, _ => False

@[proof]
theorem zmos_family_acyclic (f : ZmosFamily) : ¬ ZmosSupersedes f f := by
  intro h
  cases h <;> contradiction

end ADR.Zmos
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Absolute Traceability**: The full operator algebra chain—from Lean proof to Rust FFI to runtime enforcement—is mathematically verified and auditable.
- **Zero Spectral Drift**: Numerical implementations cannot silently violate the Lean-proved `spectralBoundCondition`; the Rust runtime rejects violations before they propagate.
- **Audit-Ready Provenance**: Every ZMOS operator instance carries a provenance record linking it to its Lean theorem and Rust FFI validation, satisfying the Sedona Spine CFP.
- **Extensibility**: The `ZMOSv2` supersession protocol allows evolution of the operator algebra without breaking historical audit trails.

### Negative
- **FFI Complexity**: The Lean↔Rust boundary requires rigorous marshaling of `Operator` structs across the C ABI, adding serialization overhead and potential for subtle memory-unsafe bugs if `unsafe` blocks are misused.
- **Performance Overhead**: Runtime spectral bound checks add latency to every operator construction; for high-throughput paths, this may require caching or batch validation strategies.
- **Proof Maintenance Burden**: Any change to `Zmos.lean` requires re-running Kani and updating the `Archivum` witness, increasing CI time.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Formalize ZMOS ADR invariants** in `Prime/lean/adr-governance/ADR/ZmosProofs.lean` (new module), proving `ffi_spectral_radius_equivalence`, `runtime_spectral_bound_sound`, and `zmos_family_acyclic`.
2. **Create `crates/zmos/`** Rust crate with `Operator` struct, `spectral_radius` exact computation via `rug`, and `verify_spectral_bound` runtime check.
3. **Implement Kani harness** in `crates/zmos/tests/kani/spectral_bound.rs` proving `verify_spectral_bound` is sound for all public constructors.
4. **Wire FFI bridge** between `Prime/lean/ZMOS/Zmos.lean` and `crates/zmos/src/ffi.rs`, generating `build.rs` bindings.
5. **Update CI** to enforce `lake build` + `cargo kani` on ZMOS-related paths.
6. **Emit Archivum witness** `ZmosSpectralProof` on every operator acceptance, binding the Lean proof hash, Rust binary hash, and TEE hardware quote.
7. **Deprecate legacy operator paths** (if any) via a follow-up ADR establishing the `ZMOSv2` supersession chain.
