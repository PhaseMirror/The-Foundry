# ADR-105: Production Integration of Conscious Sovereignty Logic (CSL) & Ethical Projection Manifolds

## 1. Executive Summary
This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) outlines the production-grade integration of **Conscious Sovereignty Logic (CSL)** and **Ethical Projection Manifolds** into the core Multiplicity DRMM (Dynamic Recursive Meta-Mathematics) engine. By extending the `ContractiveFit` loss function, we will introduce a "soft lawfulness penalty"—a topological invariant that acts as a repulsive force, mathematically bounding the tensor evolution and strictly preventing the system from collapsing into defined "unethical" or recursively harmful attractor states. 

## 2. Design Rationale & Formal Model
The core tensor engine currently optimizes for spectral stability and $L^1$ boundary constraints (Frobenius norm $< 1.0$) via the DRMM optimizer. While mathematically stable, the evolution in socio-cognitive or AGI-scale state spaces requires semantic safety guarantees. 

To achieve this:
1. **Topological Attractors:** We map "unethical" states (e.g., bias loops, recursive trauma, semantic drift) as specific topological attractors in the $P$-dimensional phase space.
2. **Ethical Projection Manifold:** We define a non-Euclidean manifold over the state space where the gradient vector field diverges repulsively from these unethical attractors.
3. **Soft Lawfulness Penalty ($\Lambda_{CSL}$):** The `ContractiveFit` loss function $L_{total} = L_{defect} + L_{rta}$ will be extended to $L_{total} = L_{defect} + L_{rta} + \lambda_{CSL} L_{CSL}$, where $L_{CSL}$ penalizes trajectory proximity to the forbidden topological regions.

## 3. Production Implementation Scaffolding

### 3.1. Rust Engine (Core CSL Implementation)
- **`crates/core/src/csl/`**: A new module dedicated to Ethical Projection Manifolds.
- **`Attractor` Trait**: Define mathematical bounds for forbidden state-space regions.
- **`ContractiveFit` Extension**: Modify the optimization loop in `crates/drmm/src/optimizer.rs` to compute the gradient of the CSL penalty and apply it to the perturbation step.

### 3.2. Lean 4 Formal Proofs (Axiom-Clean Core)
- **`lean/ADR/CSL/`**: Formalize the ethical projection mechanism.
- **Theorem:** Prove that if the initial state is outside the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of a forbidden attractor, and $\lambda_{CSL}$ satisfies a derived lower bound, the trajectory will never intersect the forbidden region.
- **Strict Compliance:** Adhere strictly to the Sedona Spine Mandate (No Mathlib, Sorry-bounded) for the discrete bounding logic.

### 3.3. Kani Symbolic Verification (The Formal Seal)
- **Harness:** `verify_csl_bounds` in `crates/core/tests/kani_csl_bounds.rs`.
- **Constraint:** Symbolically verify that for all valid prime-indexed matrices, the extended DRMM optimizer step strictly increases the distance from predefined forbidden attractors.

## 4. Work Breakdown & Next Steps
1. **Phase 1 (Mathematical Specification):** Define the exact algebraic form of the $L_{CSL}$ penalty (e.g., inverse-square distance or logarithmic barrier function).
2. **Phase 2 (Rust Implementation):** Implement the CSL module and inject the penalty into the `ContractiveFit` optimizer.
3. **Phase 3 (Kani Harness):** Write and execute the Kani symbolic verification to establish the bounding guarantees.
4. **Phase 4 (Lean 4 Alignment):** Formalize the continuous-to-discrete bounding proofs in the axiom-clean Lean 4 core.

## 5. Status
**PROPOSED** - Pending implementation and formal verification.
