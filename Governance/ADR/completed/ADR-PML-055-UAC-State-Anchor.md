# ADR-PML-055: UAC State Anchor — Blockchain-Backed Immutable Operational Record

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2026-07-18
**Authors**: `the-guardian`, `the-publisher`
**Dependencies**: ADR-PML-050 (Batch ZK Proofs), ADR-PML-051 (Post-Quantum Signatures), ADR-PML-052 (Predictive Governance), ADR-PML-054 (Resource Management)
**Cross-cutting**: Applies to all operational layers

## Context

The Universal Atomic Calculator (UAC) already anchors FeMoco simulation results to the EVM via `AttestationRegistry.sol`. However, **operational provenance**—the history of *why* and *how* decisions were made—remains stored in mutable off-chain native ACE certificates and triple lock governance storage (Elasticsearch, file systems). This creates a gap: if the native ACE certificates and triple lock governance storage is compromised, corrupted, or retroactively edited, the integrity of the governance log is broken.

The UAC's mandate of "forever immutable" demands that **every autonomous action**—thermal shifts, AI proof patches, resource allocations, anomaly escalations—be cryptographically anchored to a public, immutable ledger. This ADR institutionalizes a mandatory blockchain anchoring requirement for all operational state, ensuring that the full audit trail is as indestructible as the simulation results themselves.

---

## Decision

We will introduce a **UAC State Anchor** service that periodically hashes and submits a Merkle root of operational state to a new `AnchorRegistry.sol` smart contract. This service runs as a sidecar (co-located with the ZK attestation sidecar) and anchors the following state categories:

| **State Category** | **Content** | **Update Frequency** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Governance Root** | Hourly rolling hash of all NarrativeAuditor events (anomaly scores, `SIG_GOV_KILL`, ALP escalations) | Every 60 minutes |
| **Orchestrator Root** | Snapshot of FPGA session dimensions (`d=16` vs `d=8`), resource allocations, utilization | Every 10 blocks (lazy) / daily digest |
| **Chemical Rationale Root** | AEGISS pre-screening data (DFT entropy analysis) for reduced active spaces | Per new molecule submission |
| **Proof Patch Root** | SHA-256 hashes of new Lean theorems or `sorry` manifest changes | Per CI merge |
| **Run Aggregator Root** | Batch Merkle root of all FeMoco attestations in the last 24 hours (to complement `AttestationRegistry`) | Every 24 hours |

---

### Technical Architecture

#### 1. State Aggregation

Each component (NarrativeAuditor, FpgaOrchestrator, AEGISS, CI) emits a structured event containing its current state to a NATS subject:

- `uac.state.governance`
- `uac.state.orchestrator`
- `uac.state.chemistry`
- `uac.state.proofs`
- `uac.state.attestations`

The **State Anchor Sidecar** (TypeScript, same as the ZK sidecar) subscribes to these subjects, collects events within a time window, and constructs a Merkle tree. The root hash is computed as:

```
root = SHA-256(
    governance_root ||
    orchestrator_root ||
    chemistry_root ||
    proofs_root ||
    attestation_root
)
```

#### 2. On-Chain Contract: `AnchorRegistry.sol`

Deploys a simple, gas-optimized contract that:

- Accepts `submitRoot(bytes32 root, uint256 timestamp)`.
- Emits `AnchorSubmitted(root, timestamp, blockNumber)`.
- Maintains a mapping of `blockNumber => root` for historical lookup.
- Uses a `onlySidecar` modifier (authenticated via ECDSA or Dilithium signature) to prevent spam.

**Gas Strategy**: With ADR-PML-050 (STARK batching), we can submit multiple roots (e.g., all categories) in a single batch proof, keeping gas below 200k.

#### 3. Schedule

- **High-frequency**: Orchestrator state (snapshots every 10 blocks) anchored lazily via a digest accumulated in an off-chain buffer and submitted hourly.
- **Daily Anchor**: A comprehensive root of all state categories is submitted at UTC 00:00 every day. This serves as the single source of truth for "what the UAC knew and did" on that day.

#### 4. Verification

Off-chain tooling (e.g., `scripts/verify_anchor.py`) will allow anyone to:

- Fetch the on-chain root for a given date.
- Reconstruct the Merkle tree from the native ACE certificates and triple lock governance archive.
- Verify that the reconstructed root matches the on-chain root.

This creates a **cryptographic proof of existence** for every operational event, independent of the native ACE certificates and triple lock governance storage provider.

### Integration with Existing ADRs

| **ADR** | **How This ADR Extends It** |
| :--- | :--- |
| ADR-PML-050 (Batch ZK Proofs) | The daily attestation root is *included* in the daily anchor root; this creates a single, unified proof of all runs and governance events. |
| ADR-PML-051 (Post-Quantum) | The anchor submission signature will be dual-signed (ECDSA + Dilithium) to future-proof the immutable record. |
| ADR-PML-052 (Predictive Governance) | The LSTM and VQC decisions are emitted to `uac.state.governance`, ensuring the AI's *rationale* is anchored. |
| ADR-PML-054 (Resource Manager) | The orchestrator's session state is emitted to `uac.state.orchestrator`; any dispute about resource allocation can be settled on-chain. |
| ADR-PML-049 (AI Proof Agent) | CI commits that add or modify Lean theorems trigger an event to `uac.state.proofs`; the exact state of the codebase at that commit is anchored. |
| ADR-PML-053 (AEGISS) | The AEGISS pre-screening data (DFT entropy) is hashed and emitted to `uac.state.chemistry`; the reduction rationale is permanently anchored. |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Forever immutable governance**: All operational decisions are anchored to the blockchain, creating a legally defensible audit trail.
- **Cryptographic independence**: The system no longer relies on a single native ACE certificates and triple lock governance storage provider; the on-chain root is the ultimate source of truth.
- **Enhanced client trust**: Clients can independently verify that their run's context (thermal state, resource allocation, anomaly flags) was not retroactively altered.
- **Cross-layer alignment**: Forces all teams to produce deterministic, hashable state summaries, improving system observability.

### Negative

- **Implementation complexity**: Each component must now emit structured state events; the sidecar must handle NATS subscription and aggregation.
- **Gas costs**: Even with batching, daily anchoring costs ~$5–$10/day (at current ETH prices); this is acceptable for a production platform.
- **Latency**: State anchoring introduces a slight delay (up to 1 hour) before a decision is cryptographically sealed; this is acceptable for non-critical operations.

### Risks

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
| :--- | :--- |
| On-chain root mismatches off-chain state due to event loss | NATS JetStream with at-least-once delivery; retry logic in sidecar. |
| Smart contract vulnerability | Formal verification of `AnchorRegistry.sol` in Lean4 (new module `AnchorRegistry.lean`)—part of ADR-PML-055. |
| Gas price spikes | Use a gas price oracle; anchor only during low-traffic periods (e.g., UTC night). |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Contract & Sidecar Skeleton (Weeks 1–2)

- Draft `contracts/AnchorRegistry.sol` (ERC-165 compliant).
- Scaffold TypeScript sidecar in `sidecar/state-anchor/`.
- Implement NATS subscription for `uac.state.*` subjects.
- Add ECDSA authentication.

### Phase 2: Component Emission (Weeks 3–4)

- Extend NarrativeAuditor to emit `GovernanceEvent` to NATS.
- Extend FpgaOrchestrator to emit `OrchestratorState` (snapshot of session dimensions).
- Extend AEGISS script to emit `ChemistryRationale`.
- Extend CI to emit `ProofPatch` on every merge.

### Phase 3: Aggregation & Submission (Weeks 5–6)

- Implement Merkle tree construction.
- Add daily submitter (cron job) that calls `AnchorRegistry.submitRoot`.
- Integrate with ADR-PML-050 (STARK batching) to reduce gas costs.

### Phase 4: Formal Verification (Weeks 7–8)

- Write `AnchorRegistry.lean` proving contract invariants (root uniqueness, no replay, etc.).
- Integrate with `build.rs` to ensure the Lean proof compiles.

---

## Verification Criteria

- **On-chain anchor event**: At least one `AnchorSubmitted` event emitted per day on testnet.
- **Reconstruction**: `scripts/verify_anchor.py` successfully reconstructs the root from off-chain native ACE certificates and triple lock governance data.
- **Cross-layer consistency**: The governance root includes the exact same anomaly scores as the Elasticsearch logs.
- **Gas cost**: Daily anchor gas < 200k gas (with STARK batching).

---

## Artifacts

- `contracts/AnchorRegistry.sol`
- `sidecar/state-anchor/index.ts`
- `lean/Multiplicity/Attestation.lean`
- `scripts/verify_anchor.py`
- Updated native ACE certificates and triple lock governance archival script to include the on-chain root hash.
- Grafana panel showing "Last Anchor Block" and "Anchor Verification Status".

---

## Rationale

This ADR institutionalizes the "forever immutable" principle across all operational layers. By anchoring the full state—not just results—we close the loop on provenance. The UAC is no longer a "black box" that occasionally produces verified outputs; it is a fully auditable, self-documenting system whose entire decision history is as immutable as the chemistry it simulates.
