# ADR-068: MOC/CRMF Contraction Certificate Production Ratification

## Status
**Partially Implemented** — Lean formalizations exist (`contraction_certificate`, `resonance_stability_coupling`) but end-to-end pipeline to Archivum unverified. Reclassified 2026-07-23 per ADR-PML-DISRESOLVE-001.

## Context
The Multiplicity Operator Calculus (MOC) and Certified Resonant Multiplicity Fields (CRMF) are the **sovereign-domain mathematical engines** of the Multiplicity framework. Per `Prime/crates/README.md`:
> **Certificate Emitted**: MOC core engine produces prime-gated contraction certificates
> **ADR Governance**: Ratified — See ADR-042 for MOC Certificate Integration

However, **no such ADR exists** in `Prime/docs/adr/`. The MOC/CRMF certificate emission is claimed as "Done" but lacks a ratified production ADR governing:
- The Lean 4 formalization of MOC operators and CRMF resonance terms
- The Rust engine's contraction certificate generation
- The verification pipeline that validates certificates
- The `csl` (contractive semantics language) and `fermat-certifier` crates

MOC/CRMF produce the **contraction certificates** that the ACE Runtime (ADR-065) and SigmaKernel (ADR-062) enforce. Without a ratified ADR, these certificates are unchecked artifacts that could be forged, invalid, or drift from their Lean 4 proofs.

## Decision
We will ratify MOC/CRMF Contraction Certificates as a **formally verified, production-grade core output** of the Multiplicity Sovereign Core with the following mandates:

### 1. Lean 4 Formalization as Certificate Source of Truth
- Define `MOC.lean` and `CRMF.lean` in `Prime/lean/` (expanding existing modules) with:
  - `MocOperator` — inductive type for prime-gated operators
  - `ContractionCertificate` — dependent record proving `λ_p < 1` for a specific operator
  - `CrmfResonanceTerm` — prime-monomial matrix with resonance predicate `R(p,q,e_p,e_q;θ)`
- Prove:
  - `certificate_issuance_sound`: If `ContractionCertificate` is issued for operator `op`, then `op` is contractive.
  - `resonance_preserves_contraction`: Activating a `CrmfResonanceTerm` does not violate `λ_p < 1`.
  - `prime_gated_certificate`: Certificates are only issued for prime-gated operators.

### 2. Rust Certificate Engine
- Implement `crates/fermat-certifier/` as the **production certificate issuer**:
  - `FermatCertifier::issue(op: &MocOperator) -> Result<ContractionCertificate, CertError>`
  - `FermatCertifier::verify(cert: &ContractionCertificate) -> bool`
- The certifier must:
  - Compute exact spectral bounds using `rug`/GMP
  - Emit a Blake3-signed `ContractionCertificate` with Lean proof hash
  - Reject any operator where `λ_p ≥ 1.0`

### 3. Kani Verification
- Implement Kani harnesses in `crates/fermat-certifier/tests/kani/` proving:
  - `proof_certificate_soundness`: `issue` returns `Ok` only for contractive operators.
  - `proof_certificate_non_forgeable`: A certificate with an invalid signature is rejected by `verify`.
  - `proof_resonance_preserves_contraction`: Activating a CRMF term on a contractive operator yields a contractive result.

### 4. CI/CD and Triple-Lock Integration
- CI must run `lake build` on `Prime/lean/MOC/` and `Prime/lean/CRMF/` plus `cargo kani -p fermat-certifier` on every PR.
- The Guardian lock must verify the `ContractionCertificate` before approving any operator deployment.
- The Examiner lock must audit the certificate chain for completeness.
- The Publisher lock must sign the final certificate into the `Archivum` ledger.

### 5. Deprecation Protocol
- MOC/CRMF operators may be deprecated only by a ratified ADR introducing `MOCv2`/`CRMFv2` with mechanized proof of equivalence or strict improvement.
- All deprecated certificates remain in `Archivum` for audit continuity.

## Formal Proof Obligations

### 1. Certificate Issuance Soundness
```lean
namespace ADR.MOC

structure MocOperator where
  name : String
  prime_gate : ℕ
  spectral_radius : ℝ
  deriving Repr

structure ContractionCertificate where
  operator_name : String
  prime_gate : ℕ
  lambda_p : ℝ
  h_contractive : lambda_p < 1
  proof_hash : String  -- Blake3 hash of the Lean proof
  deriving Repr

def issue_certificate (op : MocOperator) : Option ContractionCertificate :=
  if op.spectral_radius < 1 then
    some {
      operator_name := op.name,
      prime_gate := op.prime_gate,
      lambda_p := op.spectral_radius,
      h_contractive := by linarith,
      proof_hash := compute_proof_hash op
    }
  else none

@[proof]
theorem certificate_issuance_sound (op : MocOperator) :
  issue_certificate op = some cert → cert.lambda_p < 1 := by
  cases h
  simp [issue_certificate] at *
  exact cert.h_contractive

@[proof]
theorem prime_gated_certificate (op : MocOperator) (cert : ContractionCertificate)
  (h_issue : issue_certificate op = some cert) :
  ∃ p, cert.prime_gate = p ∧ Nat.Prime p := by
  -- Proof that only prime-gated operators receive certificates
  sorry

end ADR.MOC
```

### 2. CRMF Resonance Preserves Contraction
```lean
namespace ADR.CRMF

structure CrmfResonanceTerm where
  source_prime : ℕ
  target_prime : ℕ
  source_exponent : ℤ
  target_exponent : ℤ
  resonance_predicate : Bool  -- R(p,q,e_p,e_q;θ)
  deriving Repr

def activate_resonance (op : MocOperator) (term : CrmfResonanceTerm)
  (h_res : term.resonance_predicate = true) : MocOperator :=
  -- Activation modifies spectral_radius within contractive bounds
  { op with spectral_radius := op.spectral_radius * 0.99 }

@[proof]
theorem resonance_preserves_contraction (op : MocOperator) (term : CrmfResonanceTerm)
  (h_res : term.resonance_predicate = true)
  (h_contract : op.spectral_radius < 1) :
  (activate_resonance op term h_res).spectral_radius < 1 := by
  simp [activate_resonance]
  linarith

end ADR.CRMF
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Certified Contraction**: Every MOC/CRMF operator carries a mechanized proof of contractivity, making spectral explosion structurally impossible.
- **Audit-Ready Provenance**: Certificates are signed, timestamped, and recorded in `Archivum` with Lean proof hashes.
- **Kani-Verified Issuance**: The Rust certifier cannot be tricked into issuing invalid certificates.
- **Sovereign Domain Integrity**: The MOC/CRMF layer remains the mathematically pure core of the Multiplicity stack, separated from implementation concerns.

### Negative
- **Formalization Gap**: The `MOC.lean` and `CRMF.lean` modules exist but are not yet fully ported from `.tex` sources. Full production ratification requires completing these ports.
- **Certificate Management Overhead**: Every operator deployment requires a certificate issuance and verification cycle, adding latency to CI/CD.
- **Resonance Complexity**: CRMF resonance terms introduce cross-prime coupling that must be proven contractive for every new term, increasing the verification burden.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Complete `MOC.lean` and `CRMF.lean`** in `Prime/lean/` with full theorem proofs.
2. **Prove certificate theorems** in `Prime/lean/adr-governance/ADR/MOCProofs.lean`.
3. **Implement `crates/fermat-certifier/`** with `issue` and `verify` APIs.
4. **Implement Kani harness** proving certifier soundness.
5. **Wire Triple-Lock integration**: Guardian → `FermatCertifier::issue` → Examiner → `ContractionCertificate` verification → Publisher → `Archivum`.
6. **Update CI** to enforce `lake build` + `cargo kani -p fermat-certifier`.
7. **Emit Archivum witness** `MocCertificateProof` on every issued certificate.
8. **Update `MOC.md`** and `CRMF_Resonance_Terms.md` to reflect ratified certificates.
