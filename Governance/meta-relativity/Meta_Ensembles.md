                                                Abstract
          We formalize meta-ensembles as discrete-time recursions that combine a finite family of
      operators via an adaptive gate and a convex aggregator. We give two regimes with rigorous
      guarantees: a contractive regime on Banach spaces and an averaged-operator regime on Hilbert
      spaces leveraging Krasnosel’skii–Mann iteration. The framework supports optional composition
      via embed–glue–retract while preserving stability. We include ready-to-run code snippets and a
      benchmark plan.


1    Setting and Notation
Let (X, ∥·∥) be a real Banach space, time t ∈ N, and an index set P = {p1 , . . . , pm } with m ≥ 1.
A state is xt ∈ X. An operator family is {Πp }p∈P with Πp : X → X. A weight vector is
α(t) = (αp (t))p∈P ∈ ∆m−1 := {a ∈ Rm+ :  p ap = 1}. Optional exogenous terms: drift Bt ∈ X and
                                        P

perturbation Nt ∈ X.


2    Assumptions and Update Rule
Assumption 1 (Lipschitz operators). Each Πp is Lipschitz with constant Lp and supp Lp ≤ λ < 1.

Assumption 2 (Convex aggregator). µ(α, z1 , . . . , zm ) =      p αp zp for (α, z) ∈ ∆
                                                                                         m−1 × X m .
                                                              P


Assumption 3 (Gate). α(t) = ∆k−1 (xt ) ∈ ∆m−1 ; ∆k−1 is measurable in xt .

Assumption 4 (Errors).        t ∥Bt ∥ < ∞ and supt E ∥Nt ∥ < ∞.
                            P


    Define the time-t map

             Ft (x) := µ ∆k−1 (x), {Πp (x)}p∈P + Bt + Nt =            αp (t) Πp (x) + Bt + Nt .        (1)
                                                               X

                                                                  p

The recursion is xt+1 = Ft (xt ).

Optional composition. Let ι : X ,→ Y and R : Y → X be bounded linear maps with
                                                                               (j)
R ◦ ι = IdX . Let G : Y q → Y be nonexpansive. For q ensembles, set y (j) = ι Ft (x) and
                                                                                    

xt+1 = R G(y (1) , . . . , y (q) ).


                                                    1
3    Basic Properties in the Contractive Regime
Lemma 1 (Mixture nonexpansiveness). Under ?? 1–3,                       p αp (t) Πp (x) −       p αp (t) Πp (y)   ≤
                                                                    P                       P

λ ∥x − y∥.
Proposition 1 (Contraction with bounded noise). Assume ?? 1?? 4. With εt := ∥Bt ∥ + E ∥Nt ∥
and any fixed point x∗ of x 7→ p αp (t)Πp (x),
                              P


                                E ∥xt+1 − x∗ ∥ ≤ λ E ∥xt − x∗ ∥ + εt ,

so if supt εt ≤ ε then lim supt→∞ E ∥xt − x∗ ∥ ≤ ε/(1 − λ).


4    Averaged-Operator Variant (Hilbert Setting)
We now work on a real Hilbert space (X, ⟨·, ·⟩).
Assumption 5 (Averaged operators). Each Πp is βp -averaged, i.e., Πp = (1 − βp )Id + βp Np with
Np nonexpansive and βp ∈ (0, 1] [1, Sec. 4.2].
Assumption 6 (Common fixed points). Let Tt (x) :=             p αp (t) Πp (x). Assume           t≥0 Fix(Tt ) ̸= ∅.
                                                          P                                 T

Lemma 2 (Averagedness preserved by convex mixing). If Assumption 5 holds then for any α ∈ ∆m−1 ,
Tα (x) := p αp Πp (x) is β-averaged with β = p αp βp [1, Prop. 4.32].
         P                                  P

Theorem 1 (Krasnosel’skii–Mann with errors). Assume ?? 3–6. Consider the relaxed update

                       xt+1 = (1 − γ) xt + γ Tt (xt ) + Bt + Nt ,         γ ∈ (0, 1).                             (2)

Suppose the family {Tt } is finite and each map appears infinitely often. Then (xt ) is Fejér monotone
with respect to t Fix(Tt ) and converges weakly to a point x⋆ in this set. If, in addition, one active
                T

operator is a contraction or the family is demiregular at x⋆ , convergence is strong. [1, Thm. 5.14,
Cor. 5.15]; see also [2, 3].
Corollary 1 (Firmly nonexpansive case). If all Πp are firmly nonexpansive (βp = 1/2), then under
the hypotheses of Theorem 1 the relaxed iteration (2) converges; strong convergence holds under any
of the standard strengthening conditions (e.g., viscosity/Halpern variants [1, Sec. 5.2]).

Remark on gating. Measurable, state-dependent α(t) ∈ ∆m−1 does not change nonexpansiveness
or averagedness; no Lipschitz inflation arises from the gate itself.


5    Operator Library with Certified Parameters
Examples with computable constants:
• Linear: x 7→ Ax + b, ∥A∥ ≤ λ < 1 (contraction).

• Gradient step: x 7→ x − η∇f (x), f is L-smooth, η ∈ (0, 2/L) ⇒ averaged with β = ηL/2 [1,
  Ex. 4.38].

• Proximal: x 7→ proxηg (x) is firmly nonexpansive [4].

• Contractive denoiser: x 7→ D(x) with Lip(D) < 1.

                                                   2
6    Gate Design
Let S : X → Rr be a micro-statistic and gθ : Rr × R+ → ∆m−1 a gate; set α(t) = gθ S(xt ), τk .
                                                                                                

Examples: softmax at fixed temperature; Top-K followed by projection onto the simplex. Theory
requires only measurability and range in ∆m−1 .


7    Algorithmic Template

            Listing 1: Core Meta-Ensemble Loop (NumPy/PyTorch-like pseudocode)
import numpy as np

# operators: list of callables Pi[p](x)
# gate: returns simplex weights alpha(x) in R^m
# B_t: optional drift sequence; set to zero for theory runs

def meta_ensemble(x0, operators, gate, T, B=None, gamma=1.0):
    x = x0.copy()
    m = len(operators)
    if B is None:
        B = [0 for _ in range(T)]
    for t in range(T):
        alpha = gate(x) # in Delta^{m-1}
        z = [op(x) for op in operators]
        Fx = sum(alpha[p] * z[p] for p in range(m)) + B[t]
        x = (1 - gamma) * x + gamma * Fx
    return x



8    Evaluation Protocol
One dataset per domain; metrics: AUROC or macro-F1. Baselines: bagging, XGBoost, stacking,
MoE with softmax gate. Ablations: uniform α; single operator; remove glue; softmax↔Top-K;
temperature sweep. Use 5 seeds and pre-register operators, metrics, and thresholds.


9    Limitations
Convergence speed depends on contraction/averaged constants and perturbations. Nonconvex glue
or nonlinear aggregators may break guarantees. Statistical superiority over baselines is empirical
and currently unproven.
