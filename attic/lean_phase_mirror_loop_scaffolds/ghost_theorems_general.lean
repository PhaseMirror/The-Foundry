/-! Phase Mirror Loop scaffold: Ghost Theorems — `general` subsystem (ADR-PML-056)

Manifested from ADR-090, ADR-115, ADR-PML-051. These theorems are asserted as
"exists / is verified" in completed ADRs but have no declaration in lean/.
Each is a gated `sorry` — tracked in `alp_sorry_manifest.json`.
Discharge the sorry and remove the manifest entry to resolve the dissonance.
