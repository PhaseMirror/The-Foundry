//! Length-adaptive inference sessions — the UOR-native streaming architecture
//! for **arbitrary-length** input and output on a static-shape backend.
//!
//! hologram compiles a graph at one concrete sequence length, so a single
//! `.holo` runs at a fixed window. To support an arbitrarily long prompt and an
//! arbitrarily long generated continuation without an artificial cap, generation
//! is driven through a [`SessionProvider`]: it yields an [`HoloRunner`] whose
//! window is at least the requested length, growing on demand.
//!
//! Two providers:
//!
//! - [`FixedSession`] — one precompiled `.holo`. Its window is the baked
//!   `seq_len`; a request beyond it is a clear error (recompile larger, or run
//!   the model source for an auto-growing window).
//!
//! - [`GrowableSession`] — holds the imported + optimized [`PreparedModel`]
//!   (the length-independent prefix of compilation) and compiles a concrete
//!   window on demand. Windows grow geometrically up to the model's real
//!   `context_length`, and only the current window is kept resident
//!   (generation grows monotonically, so a smaller window is never needed
//!   again — dropping it bounds memory to one session). Recompiling a window
//!   skips import + optimization (≈⅓ of compile cost, and length-independent),
//!   so growth costs only the per-length concretize → lower → compile.
//!
//! Within a window, autoregressive reuse is content-addressed κ-label elision
//! (the unchanged prefix is recognized by address and not recomputed) — the
//! UOR-native replacement for a mutable KV-cache (architecture §5.3, class CE).
