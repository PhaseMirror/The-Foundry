//! Staged (windowed) execution over k — dictionary row `staged-execution`.
//!
//! The classical "whole model resident in memory" assumption is a residency
//! assumption, not a law (`docs/conceptual-model/01-k-representation.md`).
//! This module removes it: the parametric decoder is compiled as a sequence
//! of **stage archives** (embedding, decoder-layer blocks, head), each an
//! ordinary k-form `.holo` whose weight constants are κ-bound placeholders.
//! Execution materializes one stage against the κ-store, runs it, hands its
//! output activations to the next stage, and **drops the session before the
//! next stage materializes** — peak weight residency is a parametric WINDOW
//! (the largest stage × context), never the model. The model itself lives in
//! the κ-store (OPFS in the browser, a directory natively).
//!
//! Staged and monolithic execution are the same computation: the stage
//! graphs are emitted by the same layer-emission recipe as the monolithic
//! graph and run the same kernels in the same per-layer order, so the staged
//! pipeline reproduces the monolithic logits **byte-for-byte** (the
//! `staged-execution` witness), with the head-stage boundary placed on the
//! fused final-norm operands — see
//! [`hologram_ai_safetensors::parametric::build_parametric_stage_graphs`].
