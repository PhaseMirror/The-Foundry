"""
PIRTM Core Modules - Backend-Agnostic Runtime Logic (Phase 1+)

Exports the fundamental PIRTM operations:
- recurrence: X_{t+1} = P(Ξ X_t + Λ T(X_t) + G_t)
- projection: P(x) = clip(x, -1, 1)
- gain: Aggregation operator Λ and spectral analysis
- certify: Contractivity certificates and ACE verification
- attestation: PIRTM-native lawfulness attestations and serialization

All modules use the backend abstraction (ADR-006) and work with any
TensorBackend implementation (NumPy, MLIR, LLVM, GPU, etc.).

See ADR-006 (Backend Abstraction), ADR-004 (Contractivity Semantics).
