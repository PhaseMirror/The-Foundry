# DEPRECATED — retired `Foundations.ADR.*` shadow scaffold

Legacy parallel copy of the canonical `ADR.*` governance model (see
`packages/Foundry/ADR/README.md`). It is **not** part of the Foundry Lake
project, is never synced with the canonical type, and must not be imported.
Retained for historical reference only; slated for removal.

# ADR-036: Prime-Structured Tensor-Network Autoencoder

Formal Lean 4 implementation of ADR-036:
- Allowed prime-structured bond dimensions.
- Differentiable rank surrogate bounds.
- Invariants: Effective rank surrogate is strictly bounded by maximum allowed prime dimension.
