# DEPRECATED — retired `Foundations.ADR.*` shadow scaffold

Legacy parallel copy of the canonical `ADR.*` governance model (see
`packages/Foundry/ADR/README.md`). It is **not** part of the Foundry Lake
project, is never synced with the canonical type, and must not be imported.
Retained for historical reference only; slated for removal.

# ADR-044: Comprehensive Registry Reconciliation

Formal Lean 4 model for ADR-044:
- Invariant verification for ADR-001 through ADR-044 registry completeness.
- QMHES Promotion rule (Proposed -> Accepted upon verification).
