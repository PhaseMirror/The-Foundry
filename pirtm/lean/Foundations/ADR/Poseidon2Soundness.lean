# DEPRECATED — retired `Foundations.ADR.*` shadow scaffold

Legacy parallel copy of the canonical `ADR.*` governance model (see
`packages/Foundry/ADR/README.md`). It is **not** part of the Foundry Lake
project, is never synced with the canonical type, and must not be imported.
Retained for historical reference only; slated for removal.

# ADR-049: Poseidon2 ZK-SNARK Circuit Proof Acceleration

Formal Lean 4 model for ADR-049:
- Width 8 Poseidon2 permutation sponge circuit over Goldilocks field.
- 5,087 circuit constraint bound verification for zero-knowledge contractivity receipts.
