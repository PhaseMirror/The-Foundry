# DEPRECATED — retired `Foundations.ADR.*` shadow scaffold

Legacy parallel copy of the canonical `ADR.*` governance model (see
`packages/Foundry/ADR/README.md`). It is **not** part of the Foundry Lake
project, is never synced with the canonical type, and must not be imported.
Retained for historical reference only; slated for removal.

# ADR-051: Local PC Installation & Governed Developer Environment Protocol

Formal Lean 4 model for ADR-051:
- Local installation state verification: toolchain compatibility, release binary compilation, and path linking.
- Machine-checked zero-drift installation validation.
