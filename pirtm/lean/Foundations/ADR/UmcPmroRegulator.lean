# DEPRECATED — retired `Foundations.ADR.*` shadow scaffold

Legacy parallel copy of the canonical `ADR.*` governance model (see
`packages/Foundry/ADR/README.md`). It is **not** part of the Foundry Lake
project, is never synced with the canonical type, and must not be imported.
Retained for historical reference only; slated for removal.

# ADR-053: Universal Multiplicity Constant Lambda_m and PMRO Operator

Full formal Lean 4 proof suite for ADR-053:
- Governed Lambda_m regulator with fail-closed halt precedence theorem.
- PMRO Fourier interference operator norm bound check.
- Frobenius associator defect upper bound (delta <= 2 * sqrt(N)) and calibration drift bound.
